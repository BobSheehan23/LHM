Calculation of YTD Returns and Average Utilization\n","\n","*   The gated data is sorted by ticker and business date.\n","*   YTD return for each stock is calculated as the percentage change in 'security\\_price' from the first to the last day of the period.\n","*   Average utilization for each stock is calculated as the mean of the 'utilization' values over the period.\n","*   YTD returns and average utilization are combined into a single analysis DataFrame.\n","*   Stocks with missing data for either metric in the analysis DataFrame are removed.\n","\n","## 5. Decile Analysis\n","\n","*   Stocks in the analysis DataFrame are sorted by their average utilization.\n","*   The sorted stocks are divided into ten equal-sized deciles based on average utilization.\n","*   The mean YTD return is calculated for each utilization decile.\n","\n","## 6.
