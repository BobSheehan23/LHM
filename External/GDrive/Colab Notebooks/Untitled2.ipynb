Non-numeric values were coerced to NaN, and rows with missing essential data for this calculation were dropped. Potential division by zero was handled by setting the utilization to NaN.\n","3.  **Apply Value-Based Gating:** The universe of stocks was filtered to include only those with significant lending activity on the latest trading day. The gating criteria were defined as 'borrow_value' >= $1,000,000 AND 'inventory_val_amt' >= $10,000,000 on the latest trading day. The main DataFrame was then filtered to retain only the tickers that met these criteria.\n","4.  **Calculate YTD Returns & Average Utilization:** Year-to-Date (YTD) returns were calculated for each gated stock as the percentage change from the first to the last price of the period. The average value-based utilization was calculated as the mean of daily utilization over the YTD period for each stock. These metrics were combined into a single analysis DataFrame, and rows with any remaining missing values for these metrics were dropped.\n","5.  **Decile Analysis:** Stocks were ranked by their average utilization, and deciles were created. The mean and median YTD returns were calculated for each decile.\n","6.  **Extreme Group Analysis:** The performance (mean and median YTD return) of the top and bottom 50 stocks by average utilization was analyzed.

High Utilization Stocks Significantly Outperforming in YTD Returns**\n","\n","Our analysis of the R3K Securities Lending data for the period after December 31, 2024, reveals a strong correlation between high average utilization rates (a proxy for shorting activity) and Year-to-Date (YTD) stock returns. This suggests a potential \"short squeeze\" dynamic is currently in play within the market.\n","\n","**Key Findings:**\n","\n","* **Decile Analysis:**\n","  * Stocks in the highest utilization decile (Decile 10) have shown a remarkable **Mean YTD Return of 20.0%**. This is significantly higher than the returns observed in lower utilization deciles.\n","  * Conversely, lower utilization deciles generally exhibit lower mean YTD returns. For example, Decile 1 (lowest utilization) has a Mean YTD Return of 3.7%.\n","  * There is a general trend of increasing mean returns as utilization deciles increase, with Decile 10 being a clear outlier.\n","* **Extreme Group Analysis:**\n","  * The **Top 50 Most Shorted** stocks (based on average utilization) have experienced an impressive **Mean YTD Return of 20.9%**.\n","  * In stark contrast, the **Bottom 50 Least Shorted** stocks have only yielded a **Mean YTD Return of 5.3%**.\n","  * Looking at the most extreme cases, the **Top 1% Most Shorted** stocks (25 stocks) still show a strong **Mean YTD Return of 11.9%**. The **Bottom 1% Least Shorted** stocks (25 stocks) have a Mean YTD Return of 3.9%.\n","\n","**Interpretation:**\n","\n","The substantial outperformance of stocks with high average utilization rates, particularly in the top decile and the top 50 most shorted, strongly suggests that short sellers in these stocks have been under pressure. This pressure could be due to a variety of factors, including unexpected positive news, strong market momentum, or coordinated buying activity, forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, thus driving prices up further.\n","\n","The difference in returns between the most and least shorted groups is significant and warrants attention from market participants. This pattern is consistent with a short squeeze scenario, where high short interest fuels upward price momentum.\n","\n","**Potential Implications for Market Participants:**\n","\n","* **For Long Investors:** Identifying stocks with high utilization and potentially strong fundamentals could present opportunities for further gains if the short squeeze continues.\n","* **For Short Sellers:** The current market environment appears challenging for shorting, particularly in high-utilization stocks. Risk management and careful selection of short targets are crucial.\n","* **For Market Neutral Strategies:** This dynamic could create opportunities for pair trading strategies, going long high-utilization stocks and short low-utilization stocks, although careful analysis of individual stock fundamentals is still necessary.\n","\n","**Further Analysis:**\n","\n","To further investigate this phenomenon, we could:\n","\n","* Examine the sector and industry distribution of the top utilization deciles to identify any concentrations.\n","* Analyze the price action and utilization trends of individual stocks within the top decile to identify specific short squeeze candidates.\n","* Investigate the news and events surrounding the top-performing high-utilization stocks to understand the catalysts for their price increases.\n","\n","This analysis provides a compelling signal of potential short squeeze activity in the market. Further investigation is recommended to capitalize on or manage the risks associated with this dynamic.\n","\"\"\""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8890bf3a"},"source":["## Display top/bottom decile tickers\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Generate code to display the tickers for the top and bottom deciles based on the `analysis_df`.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cce1e7bd"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","Generate code to filter the analysis_df for the top and bottom deciles and display the corresponding tickers as lists.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"b6e45ce6"},"source":["# Filter for bottom decile tickers\n","bottom_decile_tickers = analysis_df[analysis_df['decile'] == 1]['ticker'].tolist()\n","\n","# Print bottom decile tickers\n","print(\"Tickers for the Bottom Utilization Decile:\")\n","print(bottom_decile_tickers)\n","\n","# Filter for top decile tickers\n","top_decile_tickers = analysis_df[analysis_df['decile'] == 10]['ticker'].tolist()\n","\n","# Print top decile tickers\n","print(\"\\nTickers for the Top Utilization Decile:\")\n","print(top_decile_tickers)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5e240779"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","The previous code failed because the 'ticker' column was not directly available in the `analysis_df`.
