The security price \"\n","    \"traded in a range between approximately $31 and $34. Short interest, as measured by `On Loan Quantity`, was stable, and \"\n","    \"`Utilization` remained steady around 30%. The `Squeeze Score` was low and stable, holding at a value of 15 for most of the period. \"\n","    \"This baseline activity suggests a lack of strong directional conviction from short sellers.\\n\\n\"\n","    \"**Phase 2: The Squeeze Event (Late May)**\\n\"\n","    \"The situation changed on May 22, 2025. The `Squeeze Score` experienced a more than threefold increase, jumping from 16 on \"\n","    \"May 21 to 53 on May 22. This spike in the Squeeze Score coincided with a sharp upward movement in the stock's price, \"\n","    \"which rose from $31.31 to $49.17 in a single day. In the days leading up to and during this event, `On Loan Quantity` and \"\n","    \"`Utilization` both saw a notable increase, with utilization climbing from 32.57% to a peak of 37.24%. This sequence could be \"\n","    \"interpreted as a classic short squeeze. The rising difficulty and risk in maintaining short positions, as quantified by the \"\n","    \"sharp increase in our Squeeze Score, preceded a rapid price appreciation as short sellers were likely forced to cover their positions.\\n\\n\"\n","    \"**Phase 3: Elevated Pressure (June)**\\n\"\n","    \"Following the late-May price surge, the pressure on short sellers did not immediately abate. The `Squeeze Score` remained \"\n","    \"elevated throughout June, peaking at 57 on June 10, indicating that conditions for a squeeze remained high. The security’s \"\n","    \"price consolidated at a new, higher plateau, generally trading between $48 and $53. Interestingly, the `On Loan Quantity` \"\n","    \"began to drift lower during this time, suggesting some short positions were being closed out, though not aggressively.\\n\\n\"\n","    \"**Phase 4: Cost Climax and Normalization (July)**\\n\"\n","    \"The month of July appears to represent the climax and potential resolution of this short-interest-driven event. The `Cost to Borrow` \"\n","    \"saw a spike, reaching a period high of 83.38 bps on July 11. This spike in borrowing costs occurred as the `On Loan Quantity` \"\n","    \"also hit its peak of over 16 million shares. This combination often signals maximum stress on short sellers, as the cost to \"\n","    \"maintain positions becomes exceptionally high. Following this climax, from mid-to-late July, both the borrowing fee and the quantity \"\n","    \"of shares on loan began to decline steadily.
