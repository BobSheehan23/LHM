Clarity and Effectiveness:\n","#    - Titles and descriptions: The descriptions from the dashboard_structure are used as subheaders. These seem generally accurate and informative, but could potentially be refined for more specific insights on each chart if needed.\n","#    - Axis labels: For single indicator charts, the y-axis label is the indicator name, which is clear. For multi-indicator line charts or dual-axis charts, generic \"Value\" or combined indicator names are used. This might need refinement to be more specific (e.g., units or percentage). For scatter plots, axis labels are the indicator names, which is appropriate.\n","#    - Visualization types: Line charts for time series trends and YoY changes are appropriate. Scatter plots for relationships are also suitable. Dual-axis charts are used for comparing indicators with different scales, which is good, but the heuristic for determining when to use dual axes (ratio of ranges) might need fine-tuning based on visual inspection.\n","#    - Scale of axes: The Plotly default auto-scaling is used. For dual-axis charts, the choice of primary and secondary axes is based on the largest range, which is a reasonable heuristic. However, manual adjustment might be necessary for specific charts to highlight certain relationships or periods.\n","#    - Layout: The 2-column layout in Streamlit is a good start for organizing charts. For dashboards with many charts, a simple grid might become long. Grouping related charts within expanders or using more sophisticated layout containers could improve navigation, but the current structure is functional.\n","#    - Interactivity: Tooltips and date range sliders are included by default in Plotly figures and were added in the generation step. These enhance exploration.\n","\n","# 2. Areas for Refinement:\n","#    - Axis Titles on Multi-indicator/Dual-axis charts: Make y-axis titles more specific when possible, perhaps including units or clearly labeling which axis corresponds to which indicator in dual-axis plots.\n","#    - Dual-axis heuristic: Visually inspect dual-axis charts to see if the automatic selection of primary/secondary axes and scaling is effective. Manual specification might be better for certain key relationships.\n","#    - Scatter plot axes: Ensure the relationship being analyzed in a scatter plot is clearly represented by the x and y axes chosen (currently it's always the first two indicators in the list). For example, in a Phillips Curve chart (CPI vs UNRATE), UNRATE is typically on the x-axis and CPI on the y-axis. The current code would plot CPI on the x-axis if it's listed first.\n","#    - Dashboard Navigation/Organization: While the current layout is functional, for a \"massive\" analysis, consider adding sidebar navigation, grouping charts with Streamlit expanders, or adding brief explanatory text for each dashboard or group of charts.\n","#    - Missing Data Handling in Visualizations: Although missing values were interpolated, charts using the `df_yoy_change` DataFrame will have initial `NaN` values (first 12 months). This is expected but should be understood when interpreting the charts.

The Excel file was determined to contain the raw data.\n","    2.  **Data Extraction and Consolidation:** Extracting time series data from the complex structure of the Excel file's 'Raw Data' sheet, which included metadata, headers, and alternating date/value columns. The data was consolidated into a single pandas DataFrame with a datetime index and FRED series IDs as column names.\n","    3.  **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handling missing values in the consolidated data using time-based interpolation. Calculating year-over-year percentage changes for all indicators to facilitate analysis of growth and momentum.\n","    4.  **Identification of Key Macro Indicators and Themes:** Categorizing the available indicators into relevant macroeconomic themes (Monetary Policy, Inflation, Employment, Economic Growth, Housing, Cross-Theme).\n","    5.  **Development of Analysis and Visualization Strategy:** Outlining a comprehensive plan for dashboard creation, specifying the themes, indicators, analysis types (time series, relationships, YoY change), visualization types (line charts, scatter plots, dual-axis charts), and target number of charts (over 50) across multiple dashboards.\n","    6.  **Implementation of Data Analysis and Chart Generation:** Generating interactive Plotly charts based on the defined strategy, using the cleaned dataframes. This step involved writing code to create various chart types and incorporating interactivity features like date range sliders and tooltips.\n","    7.  **Design and Build Dashboards (Streamlit Layout):** Designing the basic layout structure for presenting the charts as dashboards using Streamlit components (headers, columns, expanders).\n","    8.  **Integrate Charts into Dashboards (Streamlit Display Logic):** Writing the Streamlit application logic to display the generated Plotly charts within the defined dashboard layout, including introductory text and organizational elements like expanders.\n","    9.  **Refinement and Iteration:** Reviewing the generated charts and the dashboard structure, identifying areas for improvement (e.g., axis titles, scatter plot axes, layout organization), and implementing refinements in the chart generation and Streamlit display code.\n","    \"\"\",\n","    \"Data Sources\": \"\"\"\n","    The primary data source for this analysis was the 'Raw Data' sheet from the Excel file located at `/content/drive/MyDrive/Saved from Chrome/Fred_Analysis_Dashboard_V2025d.xlsx`.

Layout refinements, including the use of columns and expanders, were implemented to improve usability.\n","    -   **Iterative Refinement:** The process included reviewing the generated visualizations and layout, identifying areas for improvement (e.g., axis labeling, standardizing scatter plot axes for known relationships), and iteratively refining the chart generation and display code.\n","    \"\"\",\n","    \"Limitations\": \"\"\"\n","    Several limitations were encountered during this analysis:\n","    -   **Data Availability:** The provided Excel file did not contain data for all indicators initially considered for a comprehensive \"massive\" analysis, particularly impacting the Housing Market theme, for which no charts could be generated.

More in-depth analysis would require advanced statistical modeling or time series techniques.\n","    -   **Dashboard Complexity:** While over 50 charts were generated, integrating them into a highly sophisticated, interconnected dashboard with complex filtering or drill-down capabilities was beyond the scope of the provided tools and time constraints within this environment.
