This pressure could be due to a variety of factors, including unexpected positive news, strong market momentum, or coordinated buying activity, forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, thus driving prices up further.\n","\n","The difference in returns between the most and least shorted groups is significant and warrants attention from market participants. This pattern is consistent with a short squeeze scenario, where high short interest fuels upward price momentum as short sellers are forced to cover their positions.\n","\n","## Summary:\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","* The analysis shows a general trend where higher stock utilization deciles tend to have higher mean Year-to-Date (YTD) returns across multiple time periods, with a significant increase in mean YTD return for the highest utilization decile.\n","* Comparing extreme groups, the highest utilization groups (Top 50 and Top 1%) exhibit significantly higher mean YTD returns compared to the lowest utilization groups (Bottom 50 and Bottom 1%) across the analyzed periods.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","* The positive correlation between utilization rate and YTD return suggests a potential \"short squeeze\" effect or that highly utilized stocks are experiencing strong positive momentum.\n","* Further analysis could investigate the drivers behind the strong performance of the highest utilization deciles and extreme groups across different timeframes, such as news events, sector concentration, or market sentiment.\n","\n","## Methodology Document\n","\n","This document outlines the methodology used to analyze the relationship between stock utilization rates and Year-to-Date (YTD) stock returns based on the provided R3K Securities Lending data.\n","\n","## 1. Data Loading and Initial Setup\n","\n","* The dataset is loaded from the CSV file 'R3K\\_SecLending\\_after\\_20241231\\_clean.csv'.\n","* The 'business\\_date' column is parsed as a date object to enable time-series analysis.\n","* Error handling is included to check for the presence of the data file.\n","* For analysis periods starting after December 31, 2024, the data is filtered accordingly (e.g., from April 8th, 2025).\n","\n","## 2. Calculation of Value-Based Utilization\n","\n","* Value-Based Utilization is calculated as the ratio of 'borrow\\_value' to 'inventory\\_val\\_amt'.\n","* Both 'borrow\\_value' and 'inventory\\_val\\_amt' are converted to numeric types, with errors coerced to NaN.\n","* Rows with missing values in 'borrow\\_value' or 'inventory\\_val\\_amt' are removed.\n","* Infinite values resulting from division by zero are replaced with NaN.\n","\n","## 3. Application of Value-Based Gating\n","\n","* The analysis is focused on stocks that meet specific criteria on the most recent trading day within each analysis period.\n","* The gating criteria are: 'borrow\\_value' >= 1,000,000 and 'inventory\\_val\\_amt' >= 10,000,000.\n","* A list of tickers that meet these criteria for the latest day of the respective period is generated.\n","* The original DataFrame is filtered to include only the data for these gated tickers within the specific analysis period.\n","\n","## 4. Calculation of Returns and Average Utilization\n","\n","* The gated data for each period is sorted by ticker and business date.\n","* **YTD Returns:** Calculated as the percentage change in 'security\\_price' from the first to the last day of the respective analysis period for each stock.\n","* **Average Utilization:** Calculated as the mean of the 'utilization' values over the respective analysis period for each stock.\n","* **Rolling Metrics (63-Day and 21-Day):** Calculated as the rolling mean of utilization and the rolling percentage change of security price over the specified window size. For the final analysis, the most recent rolling values for each ticker are used.\n","* Returns and average utilization (or rolling metrics) are combined into analysis DataFrames for each period.\n","* Stocks with missing data for either metric in the analysis DataFrame are removed.\n","\n","## 5. Decile Analysis\n","\n","* Stocks in the analysis DataFrame for each period are sorted by their average utilization (or rolling average utilization).\n","* The sorted stocks are divided into ten equal-sized deciles based on utilization, dropping duplicates if necessary to ensure deciles can be formed.\n","* The mean return (YTD or rolling YTD) is calculated for each utilization decile for each period.\n","\n","## 6. Extreme Group Analysis\n","\n","* The analysis DataFrame for each period is sorted by average utilization (or rolling average utilization) in descending order.\n","* The top 50 and bottom 50 stocks by utilization are identified.\n","* The top 1% and bottom 1% of stocks by utilization are identified, provided there are at least 100 stocks in the analysis universe for that period.\n","* The mean return (YTD or rolling YTD) is calculated for each of these extreme groups (Top 50, Bottom 50, Top 1%, Bottom 1%) for each period.\n","\n","## 7. Visualization\n","\n","* Bar charts are generated for each analysis period to visualize:\n","    *   The mean return by utilization decile.\n","    *   The mean return for the extreme utilization groups.\n","* Charts are formatted with percentage Y-axis labels (no decimals), specific colors for bars (including orange for negative returns in decile charts), removed gridlines, and a source attribution \"Source: EquiLend Data & Analytics\" at the bottom right.

This pattern is consistent with a short squeeze scenario, where high short interest fuels upward price momentum as short sellers are forced to cover their positions.\n","\n","## Summary:\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","* The analysis shows a general trend where higher stock utilization deciles tend to have higher mean Year-to-Date (YTD) returns across multiple time periods, with a significant increase in mean YTD return for the highest utilization decile.\n","* Comparing extreme groups, the highest utilization groups (Top 50 and Top 1%) exhibit significantly higher mean YTD returns compared to the lowest utilization groups (Bottom 50 and Bottom 1%) across the analyzed periods.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","* The positive correlation between utilization rate and YTD return suggests a potential \"short squeeze\" effect or that highly utilized stocks are experiencing strong positive momentum.\n","* Further analysis could investigate the drivers behind the strong performance of the highest utilization deciles and extreme groups across different timeframes, such as news events, sector concentration, or market sentiment.\n","\n","## Methodology Document\n","\n","This document outlines the methodology used to analyze the relationship between stock utilization rates and Year-to-Date (YTD) stock returns based on the provided R3K Securities Lending data.\n","\n","## 1. Data Loading and Initial Setup\n","\n","* The dataset is loaded from the CSV file 'R3K\\_SecLending\\_after\\_20241231\\_clean.csv'.\n","* The 'business\\_date' column is parsed as a date object to enable time-series analysis.\n","* Error handling is included to check for the presence of the data file.\n","* For analysis periods starting after December 31, 2024, the data is filtered accordingly (e.g., from April 8th, 2025).\n","\n","## 2. Calculation of Value-Based Utilization\n","\n","* Value-Based Utilization is calculated as the ratio of 'borrow\\_value' to 'inventory\\_val\\_amt'.\n","* Both 'borrow\\_value' and 'inventory\\_val\\_amt' are converted to numeric types, with errors coerced to NaN.\n","* Rows with missing values in 'borrow\\_value' or 'inventory\\_val\\_amt' are removed.\n","* Infinite values resulting from division by zero are replaced with NaN.\n","\n","## 3. Application of Value-Based Gating\n","\n","* The analysis is focused on stocks that meet specific criteria on the most recent trading day within each analysis period.\n","* The gating criteria are: 'borrow\\_value' >= 1,000,000 and 'inventory\\_val\\_amt' >= 10,000,000.\n","* A list of tickers that meet these criteria for the latest day of the respective period is generated.\n","* The original DataFrame is filtered to include only the data for these gated tickers within the specific analysis period.\n","\n","## 4. Calculation of Returns and Average Utilization\n","\n","* The gated data for each period is sorted by ticker and business date.\n","* **YTD Returns:** Calculated as the percentage change in 'security\\_price' from the first to the last day of the respective analysis period for each stock.\n","* **Average Utilization:** Calculated as the mean of the 'utilization' values over the respective analysis period for each stock.\n","* **Rolling Metrics (63-Day and 21-Day):** Calculated as the rolling mean of utilization and the rolling percentage change of security price over the specified window size. For the final analysis, the most recent rolling values for each ticker are used.\n","* Returns and average utilization (or rolling metrics) are combined into analysis DataFrames for each period.\n","* Stocks with missing data for either metric in the analysis DataFrame are removed.\n","\n","## 5. Decile Analysis\n","\n","* Stocks in the analysis DataFrame for each period are sorted by their average utilization (or rolling average utilization).\n","* The sorted stocks are divided into ten equal-sized deciles based on utilization, dropping duplicates if necessary to ensure deciles can be formed.\n","* The mean return (YTD or rolling YTD) is calculated for each utilization decile for each period.\n","\n","## 6. Extreme Group Analysis\n","\n","* The analysis DataFrame for each period is sorted by average utilization (or rolling average utilization) in descending order.\n","* The top 50 and bottom 50 stocks by utilization are identified.\n","* The top 1% and bottom 1% of stocks by utilization are identified, provided there are at least 100 stocks in the analysis universe for that period.\n","* The mean return (YTD or rolling YTD) is calculated for each of these extreme groups (Top 50, Bottom 50, Top 1%, Bottom 1%) for each period.\n","\n","## 7. Visualization\n","\n","* Bar charts are generated for each analysis period to visualize:\n","    *   The mean return by utilization decile.\n","    *   The mean return for the extreme utilization groups.\n","* Charts are formatted with percentage Y-axis labels (no decimals), specific colors for bars (including orange for negative returns in decile charts), removed gridlines, and a source attribution \"Source: EquiLend Data & Analytics\" at the bottom right.
