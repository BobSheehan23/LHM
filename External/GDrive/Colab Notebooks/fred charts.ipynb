Accessing real-time financial data or specific historical Fed projection data directly from FRED or similar public APIs in the required format for a \"Dot Plot\" representation is challenging without specific dedicated financial APIs or a pre-curated dataset. Since direct, up-to-date access to these specific data series (Dot Plot points and a perfectly aligned market-implied curve) through the provided tools is not feasible, I will simulate representative data based on the task description and demonstrate the plotting logic.
