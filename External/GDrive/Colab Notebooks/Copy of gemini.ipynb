The answer, as you might expect, is... complicated.\\n\\nThis famous line comes from the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. In the scene, King Arthur and his knights are trying to figure out how to cross the Bridge of Death, and they need to know the velocity of an unladen swallow to answer a question posed by the bridge keeper.\\n\\nHere\\'s why it\\'s not a simple answer:\\n\\n*   **Which swallow?** The question immediately becomes, \"An African or European swallow?\" As the movie points out, the species matters. Swallows have different wing spans, weights, and flight characteristics.\\n*   **Unladen?** This refers to a swallow without any cargo. A swallow carrying nesting material, food, or other objects would have a different velocity.\\n*   **Circumstances Matter:** The velocity of any bird depends on factors such as:\\n    *   Wind speed and direction\\n    *   Altitude\\n    *   Age and health of the bird\\n    *   Motivation (is it migrating, hunting, or just loafing?)\\n\\n**Possible Guesses**\\n\\nDespite these issues, ornithologists have attempted to provide real numbers. Here\\'s a breakdown of estimates for relevant swallows:\\n\\n*   **European Swallow (Barn Swallow - *Hirundo rustica*):** Studies suggest they cruise at around 11 meters per second (about 25 mph or 40 km/h).\\n*   **African Swallow:** There isn\\'t a single \"African Swallow\" species. There are many swallow species native to Africa. If we consider the **Red-chested Swallow (*Cecropis semirufa*)** as an example, speeds are likely similar to the European swallow, maybe slightly slower due to potentially smaller wing size in some species.\\n\\n**In Conclusion**\\n\\nThere\\'s no single definitive answer. The joke is that it\\'s a seemingly precise question that\\'s actually absurdly difficult to answer definitively. So, the best answer is:\\n\\n\"It depends!\" (on the species, wind conditions, and whether the swallow is carrying anything).\\n\\nI hope this helps!\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}],"source":["# @title Connect to the API and send an example message\n","\n","text = 'What is the velocity of an unladen swallow?' # @param {type: \"string\"}\n","\n","model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.0-flash')\n","chat = model.start_chat(history=[])\n","\n","response = chat.send_message(text)\n","response.text"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PRrm9P6QDjrB"},"source":["## Gemini: Creating a prompt\n","\n","This rich example shows how you can create and configure complex prompts for Gemini.
