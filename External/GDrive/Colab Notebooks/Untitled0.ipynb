These models range from straightforward factor ranking to a more sophisticated cross-asset strategy, all designed to identify potential underperformers and generate alpha.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Model Template 1: Factor Ranking System\n","\n","**Objective:** To systematically screen and rank a universe of securities to identify those with the highest probability of underperformance based on securities lending data.\n","\n","This model can be implemented using single factors or a composite of multiple factors.\n","\n","### A. Single-Factor Ranking\n","\n","This is the most direct approach. The model would ingest daily securities finance data for a defined universe of stocks and rank them based on a single, highly predictive factor.\n","\n","**Methodology:**\n","1.  **Select a universe of securities:** Examples include US Total Cap, FTSE Developed Europe.\n","2.  **Choose a primary ranking factor:** Research indicates the following are among the most potent single factors for predicting underperformance:\n","    * **Indicative Fee:** Identified as the top-performing metric in US Large Cap, US Small Cap, and European markets.\n","    * **Demand Supply Ratio (DSR):** Measures borrow demand relative to lendable inventory; strong performance, particularly in US Small Caps and the Developed Pacific region.\n","    * **Active Utilization:** A powerful predictor, especially in European markets, consistently stronger than simple short interest metrics.\n","3.  **Daily Ranking:** Each day, rank all securities in the universe from highest to lowest based on the chosen factor's value. A higher rank indicates a higher likelihood of future underperformance.\n","4.  **Output:** A simple, ranked list of securities that can be used to generate trading ideas or as an input for risk management.\n","\n","### *Implementation Considerations (Single-Factor):*\n","* Data ingestion and preprocessing for the selected universe.\n","* Calculation of the chosen single factor (Indicative Fee, DSR, or Active Utilization) for all securities.\n","* Daily ranking algorithm to sort securities based on the factor value.\n","* Storing and presenting the ranked list.\n","\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# --- Dummy Data Generation (replace with actual data loading) ---\n","# For demonstration purposes, let's create a dummy DataFrame\n","# In a real scenario, you would load your daily securities finance data here.\n","dates = pd.to_datetime(pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=10, freq='D'))\n","security_ids = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'TSLA']\n","data = []\n","for date in dates:\n","    for sec_id in security_ids:\n","        data.append({\n","            'Date': date,\n","            'SecurityID': sec_id,\n","            'IndicativeFee': np.random.uniform(0.01, 5.0), # Example values\n","            'DemandSupplyRatio': np.random.uniform(0.1, 10.0),\n","            'ActiveUtilization': np.random.uniform(0.05, 0.95),\n","            'DailyReturn': np.random.uniform(-0.02, 0.02) # Added for portfolio examples\n","        })\n","df_securities_data = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","\n","def single_factor_ranking(df, date, factor_name):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Ranks securities for a given date based on a single factor.\n","    Higher factor value indicates higher underperformance likelihood.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    daily_df = df[df['Date'] == date].copy()\n","    if daily_df.empty:\n","        return pd.DataFrame()\n","    daily_df['Rank'] = daily_df[factor_name].rank(ascending=False, method='min')\n","    return daily_df.sort_values(by='Rank')\n","\n","# Example Usage: Rank for a specific date using 'IndicativeFee'\n","date_to_rank = pd.to_datetime('2023-01-05')\n","ranked_securities = single_factor_ranking(df_securities_data, date_to_rank, 'IndicativeFee')\n","print(f\"Single-Factor Ranking for {date_to_rank.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} (Factor: Indicative Fee):\\n\", ranked_securities)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# --- Continue with df_securities_data from above ---\n","\n","def composite_factor_ranking(df, date, factors, weights=None):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Ranks securities for a given date based on a composite score of multiple factors.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    daily_df = df[df['Date'] == date].copy()\n","    if daily_df.empty:\n","        return pd.DataFrame()\n","\n","    if weights is None:\n","        weights = [1.0] * len(factors) # Equal weights by default\n","    elif len(weights) != len(factors):\n","        raise ValueError(\"Number of weights must match number of factors.\")\n","\n","    # Calculate percentile ranks for each factor\n","    for factor in factors:\n","        # Assuming higher factor value means higher underperformance probability, so rank higher values as higher percentile\n","        daily_df[f'{factor}_Rank'] = daily_df[factor].rank(pct=True, ascending=True) * 100\n","\n","    # Calculate composite score (sum of weighted ranks)\n","    daily_df['CompositeScore'] = 0\n","    for i, factor in enumerate(factors):\n","        daily_df['CompositeScore'] += daily_df[f'{factor}_Rank'] * weights[i]\n","\n","    # Final ranking based on composite score (higher score = higher rank for underperformance)\n","    daily_df['CompositeRank'] = daily_df['CompositeScore'].rank(ascending=False, method='min')\n","    return daily_df.sort_values(by='CompositeRank')\n","\n","# Example Usage: Rank for a specific date using a composite of factors\n","date_to_rank = pd.to_datetime('2023-01-05')\n","composite_factors = ['IndicativeFee', 'ActiveUtilization']\n","# Example with equal weights, you could also define custom weights like [0.6, 0.4]\n","ranked_securities_composite = composite_factor_ranking(df_securities_data, date_to_rank, composite_factors)\n","print(f\"\\nComposite-Factor Ranking for {date_to_rank.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}:\\n\", ranked_securities_composite)"],"metadata":{"id":"jgHzFYG0AQc9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
