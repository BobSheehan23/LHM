Further to this, Trump announced significant other tariffs to come into place as of August including 50% on Copper, 50% on Brazilian imports and as much as 200% on Pharmaceuticals.\n","\n","  * **Data:** With the uncertainty generated by the tariff announcements, particularly the 50% tariff on copper, volatility can be seen in the materials market. Notably, at the end of June, fees in the US metals and mining sector reached their highest rate in the past two years, jumping by 64 bps to 132 bps.\n","\n","**TECHNOLOGY**\n","**NVDA REACHES $4 TRILLION AMID RECORD VOLATILITY**\n","Nvidia briefly became the world's first public company to reach a market value of over $4 trillion, driven by global interest in artificial intelligence (AI), as companies continue to adopt and integrate AI solutions. The stock's parabolic move has been accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume and options activity.\n","\n","  * **Data:** As NVDA’s price has surged, it has also attracted significant borrower demand. While the quantity of shares on loan is up 250% over the past month, this does not appear to be driven by outright short sellers, as short interest as a percentage of float remains low at \\~1%. The elevated on-loan figures and borrowing costs likely indicate intense hedging activity from options market makers and institutions creating structured products to meet investor demand for exposure to the name.\n","\n","**CENTRAL BANKS**\n","**BANK OF CANADA HOLDS RATES, CITING U.S. TARIFF UNCERTAINTY**\n","The Bank of Canada (BoC) held its key interest rate steady at 2.75% during its last meeting, breaking a streak of cuts. The governing council explicitly cited downside risks to growth and lifted inflation expectations stemming from the \"increase and decrease of various US tariffs,\" highlighting the challenge central banks face in setting policy amid heightened trade uncertainty.\n","\n","  * **Data:** The cautious tone from the BoC appears to be reflected in the lending markets. Borrowing demand for the iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC) has increased by 15% over the last two weeks, with the cost to borrow rising to a three-month high. This may suggest that investors are positioning to hedge against potential downside in Canadian equities amid the trade policy headwinds.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**📊 Market Technicals & Short Squeeze Risk**\n","\n","The following securities are exhibiting the highest overall short squeeze risk scores based on our models.\n","\n","| Ticker | Company Name | Squeeze Score | Squeeze Score (WoW) | Fee All (BPS) | Fee All Week Diff (BPS) | Days To Cover | Short Interest Indicator |\n","| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n","| GFSA3 BZ | GAFISA SA COM NPV | 90 | 0.0 | 1066.04 | 52.87 | 0.27 | 7.78 |\n","| NNNN | ANBIO BIOTECHNOLOGY COM CL A | 90 | 17.0 | 5146.28 | 894.24 | 0.45 | 0.23 |\n","| CPX LN | CAP-XX LTD ORD NPV | 88 | 16.0 | 3900.00 | 112.84 | 0.00 | 0.01 |\n","| LIXT | LIXTE BIOTECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS INC COM (POST RV SPT) | 88 | 38.0 | 19847.66 | 14030.76 | 0.04 | 8.93 |\n","| 4991 TT | GCS HOLDINGS INC | 86 | 35.0 | 715.35 | -52.52 | 0.11 | 4.05 |\n","\n","The following securities are showing the largest weekly increase in their short squeeze risk score, signaling escalating pressure.\n","\n","| Ticker | Company Name | Squeeze Score | Squeeze Score (WoW) | Fee All (BPS) | Fee All Week Diff (BPS) | Days To Cover | Short Interest Indicator |\n","| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n","| SPRC | SCISPARC LTD COM NPV | 80 | 76.0 | 2292.39 | -79.73 | 0.06 | 2.22 |\n","| EVOK | EVOKE PHARMA INC COM (PST REV SPT) | 78 | 76.0 | 5553.09 | 3879.61 | 0.02 | 11.71 |\n","| nan | GAMESQUARE HLDGS INC (USA) COM NPV | 85 | 66.0 | 11.02 | -2.92 | nan | 0.09 |\n","| 6683 HK | STAR PLUS LEGEND HOLDINGS LTD | 76 | 63.0 | 7459.60 | -257.38 | 0.01 | 0.42 |\n","| ONCO SF | ONCOPEPTIDES AB NPV | 64 | 63.0 | 2954.50 | -16.95 | 0.03 | 0.03 |\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**💡 Key Takeaways**\n","\n","  * **Heightened tariff rhetoric appears to be creating targeted stress in the securities lending market.** The recent surge in borrowing fees for the U.S. metals and mining sector coincides directly with new tariff threats, suggesting investors are actively pricing in future volatility and potential downside risk for the sector.\n","  * **A surge in shares on loan doesn't always signal rising bearish sentiment.** In the case of NVDA, high borrowing demand coupled with low short interest as a percentage of float points toward sophisticated hedging and financing activities, reflecting the market's complex positioning around the high-flying stock.\n","  * **Central bank policy uncertainty is translating into hedging activity.** Following the Bank of Canada's decision to pause its rate-cutting cycle due to trade concerns, a notable increase in borrowing demand for a broad-based Canadian equity ETF could indicate that investors are bracing for potential economic headwinds.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**Source: EquiLend Data & Analytics**"],"metadata":{"id":"AUymMUhwJxKV"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
