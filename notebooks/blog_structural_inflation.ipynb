    "\n",
    "Tactically, inflation rolled off the 2022 peaks. Strategically, **structural forces**\n",
    "are preventing a full reversion to the pre-COVID “lowflation” regime. Monetary policy\n",
    "can crush demand; it cannot print oil, copper, workers, or grid capacity.\n",

    "Breakevens say future inflation will be contained. But breakevens embed liquidity,\n",
    "risk premia, and Treasury supply dynamics; they are not a pure crystal ball.\n",
