# LIGHTHOUSE MACRO - ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS & METHODOLOGIES

**Institutional-Grade Macro Intelligence Architecture**

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

**"Macro, Illuminated."**

The Lighthouse Macro framework is built on three foundational pillars:

1. **Regime Identification** - Where are we in the macro cycle?
2. **Transmission Mechanisms** - How does policy/liquidity transmit to markets?
3. **Early Warning Signals** - What vulnerabilities are building?

---

## FRAMEWORK 1: ECONOMIC REGIME CLASSIFICATION

### The Four Quadrants of Macro Regimes

**Axes:**
- X-Axis: Real GDP Growth (%)
- Y-Axis: Core Inflation (% YoY)

**Quadrants:**

```
                High Inflation
                      │
    STAGFLATION       │     OVERHEATING
  (Worst for Risk)   │   (Late Cycle)
         ◄────────────┼────────────►
 Low Growth           │           High Growth
         ◄────────────┼────────────►
    RECESSION         │     GOLDILOCKS
   (Risk-Off)         │   (Best for Risk)
                      │
                 Low Inflation
```

**Trading Implications:**
- **Goldilocks** (High Growth, Low Inflation): Long equities, short volatility, risk-on
- **Overheating** (High Growth, High Inflation): Commodities, inflation protection, Fed tightening imminent
- **Stagflation** (Low Growth, High Inflation): Worst quadrant - cash, gold, defensive
- **Recession** (Low Growth, Low Inflation): Treasuries, quality defensives, Fed easing

**Key Indicators:**
- GDP Growth (quarterly)
- Core PCE Inflation (monthly)
- Employment growth
- ISM Manufacturing & Services

---

## FRAMEWORK 2: THE PHILLIPS CURVE - LABOR VS INFLATION

### Unemployment vs Core Inflation Dynamics

**Theory:**
Low unemployment → Wage pressure → Inflation
High unemployment → Wage slack → Disinflation

**Fed Policy Response:**
- **Below NAIRU + High Inflation** → Aggressive tightening
- **Above NAIRU + Low Inflation** → Easing bias
- **Flat/Vertical Phillips Curve** → Structural inflation changes

**Chart Methodology:**
- X-Axis: Unemployment Rate (%)
- Y-Axis: Core CPI (% YoY)
- Color: Time dimension (recent = hot colors)
- Fed 2% target line (horizontal)
- NAIRU estimate line (vertical, ~4.0%)

**Trading Signal:**
- **Moving toward upper-left** (low unemployment, high inflation) = Fed hawkish, risk-off
- **Moving toward lower-right** (high unemployment, low inflation) = Fed dovish, risk-on

---

## FRAMEWORK 3: YIELD CURVE ANALYSIS

### A. Yield Curve Shape

**Normal Curve (Upward Sloping):**
- 30Y > 10Y > 5Y > 2Y
- Healthy economy
- Banks profitable (borrow short, lend long)
- Risk-on environment

**Flat Curve:**
- 10Y ≈ 2Y
- Transition period
- Fed near terminal rate
- Uncertainty building

**Inverted Curve:**
- 2Y > 10Y (most important)
- Recession signal (historically 6-18 months ahead)
- Fed overtightening
- Risk-off, defensives outperform

### B. Yield Curve Spreads as Recession Predictor

**Key Spreads:**
1. **10Y-2Y Spread** (Most watched)
   - Inversion threshold: < 0 bps
   - Recession probability increases significantly after inversion + un-inversion

2. **10Y-3M Spread** (NY Fed preferred)
   - More accurate recession predictor
   - Used in NY Fed Recession Probability Model

**Chart Methodology:**
- Dual-axis: 10Y-2Y (primary), 10Y-3M (secondary)
- Recession shading (NBER dates)
- Zero line (inversion threshold)
- Current spread vs historical distribution

---

## FRAMEWORK 4: INFLATION DECOMPOSITION

### Three-Layer Inflation Analysis

**Layer 1: Headline vs Core**
- **Headline CPI** - Includes food & energy (volatile)
- **Core CPI** - Excludes food & energy (Fed's focus)
- **Core PCE** - Fed's official target (2% long-term)

**Layer 2: Components**
- **Goods Inflation** - Supply chains, manufacturing, tariffs
- **Services Inflation** - Wage-driven, stickier, ~60% of basket
- **Shelter/Housing** - Largest component, lags 12-18 months

**Layer 3: Drivers**
- **Demand-Pull** - Overheating economy, excess money supply
- **Cost-Push** - Supply shocks (oil, supply chains)
- **Wage-Price Spiral** - Self-reinforcing (most dangerous)

**Disinflation Framework:**
- **Phase 1: Goods Disinflation** (supply chains normalize) ✓ Done
- **Phase 2: Services Disinflation** (labor market cools) ← We are here
- **Phase 3: Shelter Disinflation** (rent normalization lags) ← Next

**Trading Signal:**
- Core CPI trending toward 2% = Fed pivot approaching
- Core PCE > 3% sustained = Fed stays higher for longer
- Wage growth > productivity growth = Inflation sticky

---

## FRAMEWORK 5: LABOR MARKET HEALTH - JOLTS FRAMEWORK

### The Labor Market Flow Dynamics

**Key Indicators:**

1. **Job Openings (Demand)**
   - High openings = tight labor market
   - Openings/Unemployed ratio (Beveridge Curve)

2. **Hires (Activity)**
   - Actual hiring happening
   - Lags openings (hiring friction)

3. **Quits (Worker Confidence)**
   - High quits = workers confident, can find better job
   - "Great Resignation" indicator
   - Correlated with wage growth

4. **Layoffs (Stress)**
   - Rising layoffs = deteriorating conditions
   - Leading recession indicator

**Beveridge Curve:**
- X-Axis: Unemployment Rate
- Y-Axis: Job Openings Rate (% of labor force)
- **Outward shift** = Labor market mismatch (structural issues)
- **Movement along curve** = Cyclical changes
- **Inward movement** = Labor market normalizing

**Trading Signal:**
- High openings + low unemployment + high quits = Wage pressure → Inflation → Fed hikes
- Rising layoffs + falling quits = Recession risk → Risk-off

---

## FRAMEWORK 6: THE RRP - LIQUIDITY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM

### Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) as Liquidity Gauge

**Mechanics:**
- Money Market Funds (MMFs) park cash at Fed overnight
- Earns RRP rate (currently ~5.3%)
- Alternative to T-Bills, bank deposits

**Why It Matters:**

**High RRP ($2T+ peak):**
- Excess liquidity in system
- MMFs can't find better alternatives
- Banks don't need deposits (QT era)
- Liquidity "parked" at Fed, not in markets

**RRP Drawdown:**
- Liquidity draining FROM Fed TO markets
- Could be:
  - **Bullish** - Cash entering risk assets, T-Bill supply absorption
  - **Bearish** - Funding stress, banks need deposits, liquidity crisis

**RRP vs VIX Relationship:**
- **Inverse correlation historically** (high RRP = low vol)
- **Breakdown of correlation** = Liquidity transmission broken
- **RRP depletion + rising VIX** = Major warning signal

**Chart Methodology:**
- Dual-axis: RRP Usage ($B, primary) vs VIX (secondary)
- Correlation windows
- Threshold levels ($500B = critical low)

---

## FRAMEWORK 7: CREDIT CYCLE - CORPORATE LEVERAGE & SPREADS

### High-Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (HY OAS)

**What It Measures:**
- Excess yield of high-yield bonds over Treasuries
- "Junk bond" credit risk premium
- Market's pricing of default risk

**Key Levels:**
- **< 300 bps** - Extremely tight, complacency, late cycle
- **300-500 bps** - Normal conditions
- **500-800 bps** - Elevated stress
- **> 1000 bps** - Crisis conditions (2008, 2020 COVID)

**HY OAS + Investment Grade Spread:**
- **BBB-AAA Spread** - Quality spread within IG
- Widening = Flight to quality
- **HY-IG Differential** - Relative value

**Credit Cycle Stages:**

```
1. EXPANSION
   - Spreads tightening
   - Easy lending standards
   - Corporate leverage rising
   - M&A, buybacks accelerating

2. PEAK
   - Spreads at lows
   - Maximum complacency
   - Covenant-lite loans prevalent
   - "Zombie companies" proliferating

3. DETERIORATION
   - Spreads widening
   - Lending standards tightening
   - Downgrades accelerating
   - Fed tightening biting

4. CRISIS
   - Spreads blow out (>1000 bps)
   - Credit markets freeze
   - Defaults spike
   - Fed intervention required
```

**Trading Signal:**
- HY OAS < 300 bps = Late cycle, reduce credit exposure
- HY OAS > 800 bps = Distressed opportunities, but be patient
- Rising HY OAS + flat equity vol = Divergence, credit leading

---

## FRAMEWORK 8: EXCESS BOND PREMIUM (EBP)

### Policy Transmission to Credit Markets

**What Is EBP?**
- Credit spread ABOVE what default risk alone justifies
- Measures market's risk appetite / aversion
- Calculated by Fed researchers (Gilchrist-Zakrajšek)

**Formula (Conceptual):**
```
Corporate Spread = Default Risk Premium + Excess Bond Premium
                   (Justified by fundamentals)  (Risk aversion)
```

**Why It Matters:**
- **High EBP** = Market demands extra compensation beyond defaults
  - Credit conditions tight
  - Risk-off
  - Financial stress building

- **Low EBP** = Market accepting low compensation
  - Credit conditions easy
  - Risk-on
  - Potentially complacent

**EBP vs Fed Funds:**
- **Fed hiking + EBP rising** = Policy tightening working, credit conditions tightening
- **Fed hiking + EBP falling** = Policy NOT transmitting, "Fed put" still in effect
- **Fed cutting + EBP spiking** = Crisis mode, Fed behind curve

---

## FRAMEWORK 9: CREDIT IMPULSE

### Leading Indicator of Economic Activity

**Definition:**
- **Credit Impulse** = Change in credit growth rate
- NOT level of credit, NOT growth rate, but ACCELERATION

**Formula:**
```
Credit Growth = (Total Credit / GDP) YoY change
Credit Impulse = Δ(Credit Growth)
```

**Why It Leads:**
- Credit growth accelerating → More spending/investment → GDP growth ahead
- Credit growth decelerating → Less spending → GDP slowdown ahead
- Leads GDP by ~6-9 months

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive Credit Impulse** = Credit accelerating
  - Bullish for growth
  - Bullish for risk assets
  - Cyclicals outperform

- **Negative Credit Impulse** = Credit decelerating
  - Bearish for growth
  - Shift to defensives
  - Leading recession indicator

**Chart Methodology:**
- Single axis: Credit Impulse (% of GDP)
- Zero line (critical threshold)
- Shade positive (green) vs negative (red)
- Overlay GDP growth (lagged)

---

## FRAMEWORK 10: MONEY MARKET PLUMBING - SOFR, EFFR, OBFR

### The Fed's Operational Framework

**Three Key Rates:**

1. **SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)**
   - Secured (backed by Treasuries)
   - Repo market rate
   - Replaced LIBOR
   - Volume: ~$1T daily

2. **EFFR (Effective Federal Funds Rate)**
   - Unsecured (bank-to-bank lending)
   - Fed's primary target rate
   - Volume: ~$100B daily

3. **OBFR (Overnight Bank Funding Rate)**
   - Broader unsecured rate
   - Includes Fed Funds + Eurodollar

**Spread Dynamics:**

**Normal Conditions:**
```
OBFR ≈ EFFR < SOFR
(Unsecured rates slightly above secured)
```

**Stress Conditions:**
```
SOFR >> EFFR/OBFR
(Secured funding premium - collateral flight)
```

**SOFR-EFFR Spread as Stress Indicator:**
- **< 5 bps** - Normal, ample liquidity
- **5-10 bps** - Minor stress
- **> 15 bps** - Funding stress (Sept 2019 repo crisis = 300 bps spike)

**Trading Signal:**
- SOFR-EFFR widening = Repo market stress → Risk-off
- OBFR-EFFR widening = Bank funding stress → Financial conditions tightening

---

## FRAMEWORK 11: DEALER POSITIONING & TREASURY MARKET FUNCTION

### Primary Dealer Inventory as Liquidity Gauge

**Who Are Primary Dealers?**
- 24 banks/brokers authorized to trade with NY Fed
- Market makers in Treasuries
- Required to participate in Treasury auctions

**Dealer Positioning Signals:**

**Large Long Position (Dealers own lots of Treasuries):**
- Warehousing supply
- Risk: Dealers may need to offload
- Vulnerable to rate sell-off

**Large Short Position (Dealers short Treasuries):**
- Facilitating client demand
- Potential short squeeze
- Bullish for Treasuries

**Net Zero / Small Position:**
- Efficient market functioning
- Good liquidity
- Low stress

**Chart Methodology:**
- Net Dealer Position by maturity (Bills, Notes, Bonds)
- Zero line
- Historical extremes (±$100B+ = extreme)

---

## FRAMEWORK 12: SWAP SPREADS

### Interbank Credit Health & Basis Trade Capacity

**What Is a Swap Spread?**
```
Swap Spread = Swap Rate - Treasury Yield
              (Same maturity)
```

**Example:**
- 10Y Swap Rate: 4.50%
- 10Y Treasury: 4.30%
- 10Y Swap Spread: +20 bps

**Normal Positive Spread:**
- Swap = interbank credit risk
- Treasury = risk-free
- Positive spread reflects credit premium

**Negative Swap Spread (Anomaly):**
- Treasury yields > swap rates
- Happened in 2015-2016
- Reflects:
  - Treasury scarcity (QE reduced supply)
  - Dealer balance sheet constraints (post-2008 regulation)
  - Basis trade capacity limits

**Swap Spread Widening:**
- Interbank credit stress rising
- Bank funding costs increasing
- Liquidity deteriorating
- Risk-off signal

**Chart Methodology:**
- Multiple swap spreads: 2Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y
- Zero line (positive vs negative)
- Historical context (2008 crisis, 2016 negative spreads)

---

## FRAMEWORK 13: CROSS-CURRENCY BASIS SWAP

### Global Dollar Funding Stress Gauge

**What Is It?**
- Cost for non-USD entities to borrow dollars
- Swap foreign currency for USD, return at maturity
- Should be ~0 (covered interest parity) but often isn't

**EUR/USD 3M Basis:**
- **Negative basis** = Premium to borrow USD
  - Non-US banks/firms desperate for dollars
  - Dollar shortage globally
  - Crisis indicator (2008, 2020 = -100 bps+)

- **Positive basis** = Premium to borrow EUR
  - Rare, means dollar abundant

**JPY/USD Basis:**
- Japanese banks/institutions major dollar borrowers
- Negative basis = carry trade stress
- Widening = yen strength ahead (unwind carry)

**Trading Signals:**
- EUR/USD basis < -50 bps = Major dollar shortage → Risk-off, Fed swap lines likely
- Basis normalizing (→ 0) = Stress easing → Risk-on
- Basis + VIX correlation = Global stress confirmation

---

## FRAMEWORK 14: STABLECOIN SUPPLY AS CRYPTO LIQUIDITY

### Stablecoins as "Dry Powder" for Crypto Markets

**Key Stablecoins:**
1. **USDT (Tether)** - Largest, ~$80B
2. **USDC (Circle)** - Regulated, ~$25B
3. **DAI (MakerDAO)** - Decentralized, ~$5B

**Stablecoin Supply Dynamics:**

**Rising Supply:**
- New capital entering crypto
- "Dry powder" on sidelines
- Historically precedes BTC rallies
- Bullish 3-6 month lead

**Falling Supply:**
- Capital leaving crypto
- Off-ramping to USD
- Bearish for crypto

**Stablecoin vs Bitcoin Price:**
- Stablecoin supply = ammunition
- BTC price = target
- **High correlation** = Healthy market
- **Divergence** (supply up, BTC flat) = Accumulation phase, bullish setup

---

## FRAMEWORK 15: STABLECOINS VS MONEY MARKET FUNDS

### Digital Dollar Competition

**The Competition:**
- **Stablecoins** - On-chain, 24/7, global, programmable
- **MMFs** - Traditional, regulated, institutional, ~$6T

**Why It Matters:**
- Stablecoins backed by Treasuries + repos (same as MMFs)
- Competing for same collateral
- Stablecoin growth = T-Bill demand
- Potential future: Stablecoins eat MMF market share

**Yield Comparison:**
- MMF yield: ~5.3% (follows Fed Funds)
- Stablecoin yield: 0% (USDT/USDC don't pay yield)
- **BUT:** DeFi protocols pay 4-8% on stablecoins

**Market Structure Implications:**
- Stablecoin supply growth → Structural T-Bill bid
- Stablecoin runs (depegging) → Money market contagion risk
- Regulatory clarity = unlock institutional adoption

---

## FRAMEWORK 16: BITCOIN REALIZED VOLATILITY VS VIX

### Crypto-Traditional Market Integration

**Realized Volatility:**
```
Realized Vol = Std Dev(Daily Returns) × √365 × 100
               (Annualized %)
```

**BTC 30-Day Realized Vol:**
- Typically 40-80% (vs equity ~15-25%)
- Mean-reverting
- Spikes during crashes/rallies

**BTC Vol vs VIX Comparison:**

**High Correlation Regime:**
- BTC trading like risk-on asset
- Crypto integrated with traditional markets
- "Risk-on/risk-off" driver

**Low Correlation Regime:**
- BTC trading on crypto-native factors
- Decoupled from traditional finance
- "Digital gold" narrative

**Convergence:**
- BTC vol declining over time (maturation)
- Still 2-3x equity vol
- Institutional adoption = further convergence

---

## FRAMEWORK 17: OFR FINANCIAL STRESS INDEX (FSI)

### System-Wide Stress Composite

**What Is FSI?**
- Office of Financial Research (OFR) composite index
- Combines 33 market-based indicators
- Standardized (mean = 0, std dev = 1)

**Components:**
1. **Credit** - Spreads, default risk
2. **Equity Valuation** - Volatility, valuations
3. **Funding** - Repo, LIBOR-OIS, TED spread
4. **Safe Assets** - Treasury yields, flight to quality
5. **FX** - Dollar strength, EM stress

**Interpretation:**
- **FSI < 0** - Below average stress (normal)
- **FSI = 0 to 1** - Moderate stress
- **FSI > 1** - Elevated stress (1 std dev above normal)
- **FSI > 2** - Severe stress (2008, 2020)

**Trading Signals:**
- FSI crossing 0 → 1 = Risk reduction, hedge
- FSI > 1.5 = Major de-risking, Fed intervention likely
- FSI declining from peaks = Risk-on recovery

---

## FRAMEWORK 18: NY FED RECESSION PROBABILITY MODEL

### 10Y-3M Spread as Recession Predictor

**Model:**
```
P(Recession in 12 months) = f(10Y - 3M Spread)
```

**Thresholds:**
- **< 10% probability** - Low risk
- **10-30%** - Elevated risk, monitor
- **30-50%** - High risk, position defensively
- **> 50%** - Recession likely within 12 months

**Historical Accuracy:**
- Predicted all recessions since 1960
- Few false positives
- Lead time: 6-18 months

**Limitations:**
- QE/QT distorts term premium
- "This time is different" trap
- Probability ≠ certainty

**Trading Strategy:**
- > 30% = Reduce cyclical exposure, add defensives
- > 50% = Recession portfolio (long duration, quality, gold)
- Declining from peak = Recovery positioning

---

## FRAMEWORK 19: LIQUIDITY COMPOSITE DASHBOARD

### Multi-Dimensional Liquidity Gauge

**Four Pillars of Liquidity:**

1. **Central Bank Liquidity**
   - Fed balance sheet
   - RRP facility usage
   - QE/QT pace

2. **Market Liquidity**
   - Bid-ask spreads
   - Treasury market depth
   - Dealer positioning

3. **Funding Liquidity**
   - SOFR-EFFR spread
   - Repo rates
   - TED spread (LIBOR-OIS)

4. **Private Liquidity**
   - M2 money supply growth
   - Bank credit growth
   - C&I loan growth

**Dashboard Approach:**
- 4 panels, each showing one pillar
- Traffic light system (green/yellow/red)
- Composite score (1-10)

**Interpretation:**
- **All green (8-10)** = Ample liquidity, risk-on
- **Mixed (5-7)** = Neutral, selective
- **All red (1-4)** = Liquidity crisis, extreme caution

---

## FRAMEWORK 20: CORPORATE LEVERAGE - DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

### Nonfinancial Corporate Debt to GDP

**What It Measures:**
- Corporate sector leverage relative to economic size
- Debt sustainability
- Potential deleveraging risk

**Key Levels:**
- **< 40%** - Low leverage, healthy
- **40-45%** - Moderate leverage
- **45-50%** - Elevated leverage
- **> 50%** - High leverage, vulnerable to rates

**Debt Service Coverage:**
- Interest expense / Operating income
- Rising rates = rising debt service
- Zombie companies (can't cover interest)

**Leverage Cycle:**

```
1. Low Leverage → Cheap credit → Borrow for growth/M&A
2. Rising Leverage → Credit spreads still tight
3. Peak Leverage → Rates rise, spreads widen
4. Deleveraging → Default/restructure/paydown
```

**Trading Signal:**
- Debt/GDP > 50% + Fed hiking = Credit risk rising
- Deleveraging cycle = Bearish equities, bullish HY distressed

---

## PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: THE LIGHTHOUSE MACRO INVESTMENT PROCESS

### Step 1: Regime Identification
1. Check Economic Cycle Scatter (growth vs inflation quadrant)
2. Confirm with Phillips Curve positioning
3. Review ISM Composite (expansion vs contraction)

### Step 2: Policy Assessment

2. Fed balance sheet trajectory (QE/QT)
3. Real rates (nominal - inflation)

### Step 3: Transmission Check
1. RRP dynamics (liquidity draining or parking)
2. Credit spreads (HY OAS, EBP)
3. Money market plumbing (SOFR-EFFR)

### Step 4: Vulnerability Scan
1. Financial Stress Index (OFR FSI)
2. Recession probability (NY Fed model)
3. Corporate leverage + debt service

## PROPRIETARY LIGHTHOUSE INDICATORS

### These are the ACTUAL custom indicators we've built and published

---

## INDICATOR 1: LIQUIDITY CUSHION INDEX (LCI)

**Formula:**
```
LCI = Z-score average of:
  - ON RRP / GDP
  - Bank Reserves / GDP
```

**What It Measures:**
- System's shock-absorption capacity
- Size of liquidity buffers available to absorb stress
- Financial system resilience

**Interpretation:**
- **High LCI (>+1σ)** - Ample liquidity cushion, resilient to shocks
- **Neutral LCI (0σ)** - Average cushion
- **Low LCI (<-1σ)** - Depleted cushion, vulnerable to shocks

**Historical Context:**
- Flat pre-2008 (no excess reserves before QE)
- Peaked 2021-2022 (QE era, RRP at $2T+)
- Currently depleted (QT + RRP drawdown)

**Trading Signal:**
- Low LCI + rising volatility = High fragility, reduce risk
- LCI improving = System resilience building, risk-on

**Chart Implementation:**
- Dual-axis: RRP/GDP and Reserves/GDP (both z-scored)
- Composite LCI (average of both)
- Threshold bands (-1σ, 0, +1σ)

---

## INDICATOR 2: YIELD-FUNDING STRESS (YFS) COMPOSITE

**Formula:**
```
YFS = Composite of:
  - Yield curve inversion (10Y-2Y, 10Y-3M)
  - Money market plumbing metrics (SOFR-EFFR, BGCR-EFFR)
  - Repo stress indicators
```

**What It Measures:**
- Funding stress in repo markets
- Financial plumbing health
- Transmission mechanism blockages

**Key Component: BGCR-EFFR Spread**
- **BGCR** = Broad General Collateral Rate (secured repo)
- **EFFR** = Effective Fed Funds Rate (unsecured)
- Normal: BGCR slightly below EFFR (secured cheaper than unsecured)
- **Stress: BGCR > EFFR** (collateral premium, flight to safety)

**Interpretation:**
- **Low YFS** - Smooth funding markets, healthy plumbing
- **Elevated YFS** - Funding stress building, pre-crisis configuration
- **Spiking YFS** - Crisis conditions (Sept 2019, March 2020)

**Trading Signal:**
- YFS rising + Low LCI = Major warning, reduce leverage
- YFS normalizing = Funding stress easing, risk-on

---

## INDICATOR 3: REPO RATE DISPERSION INDEX

**Formula:**
```
Repo Rate Dispersion = 99th percentile BGCR - 1st percentile BGCR
vs. Tri-party repo volume
```

**What It Measures:**
- Uneven funding access across market participants
- Liquidity fragmentation
- Two-tier repo market (haves vs have-nots)

**Interpretation:**
- **Low dispersion** - Even funding access, healthy market
- **Rising dispersion** - Some participants paying up for funding
- **High dispersion** - "Classic pre-stress configuration", liquidity fragmented

**Why It Matters:**
- Low average repo rate can mask rising dispersion
- Dispersion rises BEFORE average rate blows out
- Leading indicator of funding crisis

**Trading Signal:**
- Dispersion widening + low tri-party volume = Funding stress, caution
- Dispersion normalizing = Market functioning improving

---

## INDICATOR 4: LABOR FRAGILITY INDEX (LFI)

**Formula:**
```
LFI = Z-score composite of:
  + Long-duration unemployment share (% unemployed >27 weeks)
  - Quits rate (inverted - lower quits = higher fragility)
  - Hires/Quits ratio (inverted - lower ratio = higher fragility)
```

**What It Measures:**
- Labor market resilience
- Job-finding effectiveness
- Re-employment dynamics

**Interpretation:**
- **Low LFI** - Robust labor market, easy to find jobs
- **Rising LFI** - Deteriorating re-employment, harder to find jobs
- **High LFI** - Fragile labor market despite stable headline unemployment

**Why It Matters:**
- Unemployment rate is lagging indicator
- LFI deteriorates BEFORE unemployment spikes
- Captures quality of labor market, not just quantity

**Trading Signal:**
- Rising LFI + stable unemployment = Late-cycle warning
- LFI peaking + labor policy easing = Labor market bottoming

---

## INDICATOR 5: LABOR DYNAMISM INDEX (LDI)

**Formula:**
```
LDI = Z-score composite of:
  + Quits rate
  + Hires/Quits ratio
  + Quits/Layoffs ratio
```

**What It Measures:**
- Worker optionality
- Job-switching propensity
- Labor market confidence

**Interpretation:**
- **High LDI** - Workers confident, switching jobs, wage pressure
- **Declining LDI** - Workers holding onto jobs, dynamism fading
- **Low LDI** - Stagnant labor market, low optionality

**Why It Matters:**
- **"Tends to lead payroll growth by a few quarters"**
- Quits decline before hiring slows
- Early warning of employment deterioration

**Trading Signal:**
- LDI declining while payrolls stable = Employment weakness ahead
- LDI bottoming = Labor market recovery ahead (3-6 month lead)

---

## INDICATOR 6: PAYROLL GROWTH VS QUITS RATE DIVERGENCE

**Formula:**
```
Divergence = Headline Payroll YoY Growth - Quits Rate (z-score matched)
```

**What It Measures:**
- Disconnect between headline employment and labor dynamism
- Late-cycle labor market behavior

**Key Insight:**
**"Payrolls can stay positive while quits slide—that's a late-cycle tell"**

**Interpretation:**
- **Quits declining, payrolls stable** - Late cycle, weakness building
- **Quits recovering, payrolls lagging** - Early cycle recovery
- **Both declining** - Recession in progress

**Trading Signal:**
- Divergence widening (payrolls > quits) = Labor market weaker than headline
- Divergence closing = Labor market genuinely strengthening

---

## INDICATOR 7: HOURS WORKED VS EMPLOYMENT DIVERGENCE

**Formula:**
```
Hours YoY - Employment YoY
(Utilization)   (Headcount)
```

**What It Measures:**
- Firm adjustment mechanisms
- Leading indicator of layoffs

**Key Insight:**
**"Hours represent the first lever firms pull"**

**Sequence:**
1. **Hours decline first** (reduce overtime, cut hours)
2. **Temp workers laid off** (easiest to cut)
3. **Hiring freezes** (stop adding)
4. **Layoffs** (permanent headcount reduction)

**Interpretation:**
- Hours declining, employment stable = Layoffs coming
- Both declining = Labor market deteriorating
- Hours recovering first = Recovery ahead

**Trading Signal:**
- Hours YoY < Employment YoY = Earnings pressure, caution cyclicals
- Hours recovering = CapEx cycle turning, bullish cyclicals

## INDICATOR 8: CREDIT-LABOR GAP (CLG)

**Formula:**
```
CLG = Z(High-Yield OAS) - Z(Labor Fragility Index)
```

**What It Measures:**
- Credit spread adequacy relative to labor market stress
- Risk compensation mismatch

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive CLG** - Spreads wide relative to labor stress (good compensation)
- **Zero CLG** - Spreads appropriately priced
- **Negative CLG** - "Spreads too tight relative to macro fragility"

**Key Insight:**
**"Historically a pre-widening configuration"** when CLG goes negative

**Why It Matters:**
- Credit markets often complacent when labor deteriorates
- Labor stress → corporate earnings pressure → defaults
- CLG identifies this mismatch early

**Trading Signal:**
- CLG turning negative = Reduce credit exposure, spreads will widen
- CLG widening from negative = Credit repricing, opportunity emerging

---

## INDICATOR 9: HIGH-YIELD SPREAD VS VOLATILITY IMBALANCE

**Formula:**
```
Imbalance = HY Spread (Z-score) vs. Realized HY Spread Volatility (Z-score)
```

**What It Measures:**
- Risk-compensation mismatch
- Spread tightness relative to spread volatility

**Key Insight:**
**"Tight spreads with rising vol = poor compensation for risk; a late-cycle mismatch"**

**Interpretation:**
- **Tight spreads + low vol** - Normal risk-on environment
- **Tight spreads + rising vol** - DANGER - poor compensation
- **Wide spreads + high vol** - Crisis, but volatility priced in
- **Wide spreads + falling vol** - Recovery, opportunity

**Trading Signal:**
- Imbalance growing (spreads tight, vol rising) = Reduce HY exposure
- Imbalance normalizing = Re-enter credit

---

## INDICATOR 10: EQUITY MOMENTUM DIVERGENCE (EMD)

**Formula:**
```
EMD = Distance from medium/long-term SPX trend / Realized Volatility (Z-score)
```

**What It Measures:**
- Stretched momentum
- Shock-absorption capacity in equities
- Overbought/oversold conditions adjusted for volatility

**Interpretation:**
- **EMD > +1σ** - "Stretched momentum with thin shock-absorption—prone to air-pockets"
- **EMD neutral (0σ)** - Balanced momentum
- **EMD < -1σ** - Oversold, potential mean reversion

**Why Volatility Adjustment Matters:**
- Price distance alone misleading (10% in low vol vs high vol very different)
- Volatility-adjusted captures true risk of reversal

**Trading Signal:**
- EMD > +1σ + deteriorating macro = Reduce equity beta, hedge
- EMD < -1σ + improving macro = Tactical long entry

---

## INDICATOR 11: QUALITY VS RISK (QUAL/SPY RATIO)

**Formula:**
```
Valuation Ratio = iShares MSCI USA Quality ETF / S&P 500 ETF
```

**What It Measures:**
- Market preference for quality vs risk-taking
- Late-cycle vs early-cycle positioning

**Quality Characteristics:**
- High ROE
- Stable earnings
- Low leverage
- Consistent dividend growth

**Interpretation:**
- **QUAL outperforming (ratio rising)** - Risk-off, quality bid
- **QUAL underperforming (ratio declining)** - Risk-on, junk rally
- **Ratio at cycle lows** - Maximum risk appetite

**Key Insight:**
**"Currently at cycle lows despite macro deterioration; signals late-stage bull market behavior"**

**Trading Signal:**
- Ratio declining + macro deteriorating = Complacency, major warning
- Ratio bottoming + volatility spiking = Rotation to quality beginning

---

## INDICATOR 12: MACRO RISK INDEX (MRI)

**Formula:**
```
MRI = Z-score composite of:
  + Labor Fragility Index (LFI)
  - Labor Dynamism Index (LDI) [inverted]
  + Yield-Funding Stress (YFS)
  + Credit Spread Elevation (CSE)
  + Equity Momentum Divergence (EMD)
  - Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI) [inverted]
```

**What It Measures:**
- **Aggregate macro risk across all dimensions:**
  - Liquidity
  - Labor
  - Credit
  - Equity

**Interpretation:**
- **MRI < 0** - Below-average macro risk
- **MRI 0-1** - Moderate risk
- **MRI > 1** - Elevated risk (1σ above normal)
- **MRI > 2** - Severe risk (2σ)

**Key Insight:**
**"Rising MRI while equities climb indicates markets are under-pricing macro risk"**

**Divergence Patterns:**
- **MRI rising, SPX rising** - Complacency, eventual correction
- **MRI rising, SPX flat** - Healthy consolidation
- **MRI falling, SPX rising** - Healthy bull market
- **MRI falling, SPX flat** - Recovery not yet priced in

**Trading Signal:**
- MRI > 1σ = Defensive positioning, reduce beta, add hedges
- MRI > 2σ = Crisis configuration, maximum caution
- MRI declining from peaks = Re-risk, add beta

## THE LIGHTHOUSE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### Three-Lens Regime Classification

**We apply three lenses to each indicator:**

1. **Threshold Bands**
   - Simple z-score thresholds
   - -1σ, 0, +1σ, +2σ
   - Easy interpretation

2. **Markov Regime-Switching**
   - Statistical model identifies regime changes
   - Accounts for persistence (regimes don't flip daily)
   - Probabilistic regime assignment

3. **Proprietary Rotation Framework**
   - Combines multiple indicators
   - Sector rotation signals
   - Risk-on/risk-off positioning

**Combined Output:** Economic regime classification with confidence intervals

## PUTTING THE PROPRIETARY INDICATORS TOGETHER

### Early Warning System Architecture

**Layer 1: Liquidity Foundation**
- Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)
- Yield-Funding Stress (YFS)
- Repo Rate Dispersion

**Layer 2: Labor Market Health**
- Labor Fragility Index (LFI)
- Labor Dynamism Index (LDI)
- Payroll-Quits Divergence
- Hours-Employment Divergence

**Layer 3: Credit Market Stress**
- Credit-Labor Gap (CLG)
- HY Spread vs Volatility Imbalance

**Layer 4: Equity Market Positioning**

- Quality vs Risk Ratio (QUAL/SPY)

**Layer 5: Composite Risk**
- Macro Risk Index (MRI)

### Decision Tree:

```
1. Is LCI depleted? (< -1σ)
   ├─ YES → Vulnerable system, proceed with caution
   └─ NO → Resilient system, can take risk

2. Is YFS elevated? (> +1σ)
   ├─ YES → Funding stress building, reduce leverage
   └─ NO → Plumbing healthy, normal operations

3. Is LFI rising?
   ├─ YES → Labor market deteriorating
   │        ├─ Check LDI: Also falling? → Employment weakness ahead
   │        └─ Check payrolls: Still positive? → Late-cycle divergence
   └─ NO → Labor market stable/improving

4. Is CLG negative?
   ├─ YES → Credit spreads too tight, reduce HY
   └─ NO → Credit appropriately priced

5. Is EMD > +1σ?
   ├─ YES → Equity momentum stretched, hedge
   └─ NO → Equity momentum healthy

6. Is QUAL/SPY at cycle lows while MRI rising?
   ├─ YES → MAJOR RED FLAG - complacency + deterioration
   └─ NO → Market positioning appropriate

7. What is MRI reading?
   ├─ > +2σ → CRISIS MODE - maximum defensive
   ├─ +1σ to +2σ → ELEVATED RISK - reduce beta, add hedges
   ├─ 0 to +1σ → MODERATE RISK - balanced, selective
   └─ < 0 → LOW RISK - risk-on, add beta
```
