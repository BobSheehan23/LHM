**MRI:** +0.06σ (Near neutral)

## SECTION I: PROPRIETARY INDICATORS

### MRI_Macro_Risk_Index.png

**Macro Risk Index (MRI): +0.06σ**

- **Current Reading:** Near neutral (+0.06σ) — markets pricing risk appropriately
- **Primary Driver:** Liquidity Cushion Index at -1.45σ (bank reserves + RRP depleted) partially offset by other factors
- **Labor Signals:** Fragility elevated (+0.57σ) but dynamism only moderately weak (-0.53σ)
- **Historical Context:** MRI readings >+2σ preceded 2008 crisis, COVID crash, 2022 bear market
- **Interpretation:** While liquidity stress is real, composite suggests risk is fairly priced — not complacent, not panic

---

### 01_LCI_Liquidity_Cushion_Index.png

**Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI): -1.45σ**

- **Current State:** Critically low (-1.45σ) — banking system liquidity 1.5 std devs below historical average
- **RRP Collapse:** Fed reverse repo facility drawn from $2.5T peak to <$300B — liquidity draining rapidly
- **Bank Reserves Flat:** Stuck at $3.5T while GDP grew — ratio deteriorating toward 2019 repo crisis levels
- **Risk Implication:** Depleted cushion increases fragility to shocks — dealers have less capacity to absorb Treasury supply
- **Watch For:** If LCI breaks -2σ, expect term premium spike, repo volatility, potential Fed liquidity injection

---

### 02_LFI_Labor_Fragility_Index.png

**Labor Fragility Index (LFI): +0.57σ**

- **Current State:** Moderately elevated (+0.57σ) — labor market showing early stress signals
- **Long-Term Unemployment Rising:** % unemployed >27 weeks climbing — labor market scarring, harder to reverse
- **Quits Rate Falling:** Workers less willing to quit — confidence deteriorating, wage pressure easing
- **Hiring Efficiency Down:** Hires-to-quits ratio declining — employers more selective, labor hoarding beginning
- **Leading Indicator:** LFI typically leads payroll weakening by 3-6 months — consumer spending at risk in Q1 2026

---

### 03_LDI_Labor_Dynamism_Index.png

**Labor Dynamism Index (LDI): -0.53σ**

- **Current State:** Below average (-0.53σ) — labor market losing vitality
- **Job Switching Down:** Quit rates falling faster than hires — workers staying put
- **Quits/Layoffs Ratio Declining:** Fewer voluntary separations relative to involuntary — confidence signal weakening
- **Structural Concern:** Low dynamism can persist — "sticky" labor weakness that compounds
- **Historical Pattern:** LDI declines precede payroll weakness by 2-3 quarters

---

### 04_CLG_Credit_Labor_Gap.png

**Credit-Labor Gap (CLG): +0.05σ**

- **Current State:** Near zero (+0.05σ) — credit spreads aligned with labor fragility
- **Q3 Divergence Closed:** CLG was +1.2σ in August (credit too tight vs labor) — gap has normalized
- **Recent Convergence:** Credit markets caught up to labor reality
- **Interpretation:** When CLG positive, credit under-prices labor recession risk — current near-zero suggests fair pricing
- **Signal:** No major mispricing between credit and labor markets currently

---

### 05_YFS_Yield_Funding_Stress.png

**Yield-Funding Stress (YFS): +0.97σ**

- **Current State:** Approaching +1σ warning threshold — money market stress building
- **Bill-SOFR Spread:** T-bills trading rich to SOFR (inverted spread) — safe asset scarcity
- **Yield Curve:** 10Y-2Y slope near zero after inversion — curve steepening but term premium compressed
- **Plumbing Risk:** YFS >+1σ historically precedes dealer stress, repo volatility, Fed intervention
- **Watch:** If YFS breaks +1.5σ, Fed may expand liquidity facilities or ease RRP drawdown pace

---

### 06_SVI_Spread_Volatility_Imbalance.png

**Spread-Volatility Imbalance (SVI): -0.15σ**

- **Current State:** Slightly negative (-0.15σ) — minor divergence between credit and equity vol
- **Concept:** Compares HY spread levels to VIX — should move together when pricing tail risk
- **Interpretation:** Negative SVI = equity vol pricing slightly more risk than credit spreads
- **Magnitude:** -0.15σ is minimal divergence — markets generally aligned
- **Actionable:** Material divergences (>±1σ) signal arbitrage opportunities or mispricing

---

### 09_Payrolls_vs_Quits_Divergence.png

**Payrolls vs Quits Divergence**

- **Divergence Alert:** Payroll growth holding while quit rates collapse — classic late-cycle pattern
- **Labor Hoarding:** Employers keeping workers despite slowing demand — productivity falling, margins compressing
- **Historical Precedent:** 2007, 2000 saw similar divergence 6 months before recession — layoffs lag quits
- **Sequence:** (1) Quits fall, (2) Payrolls decelerate, (3) Layoffs spike — currently in phase 1-2 transition
- **Timing:** Divergence suggests payroll weakness 2-4 months ahead

---

### 10_Hours_vs_Employment_Divergence.png

**Hours vs Employment Divergence**

- **Leading Indicator:** Companies cut hours before headcount — hours declining is early warning
- **Current Divergence:** Average weekly hours falling while employment growth positive
- **Cost Cutting Sequence:** (1) Freeze hiring, (2) Cut hours, (3) Layoffs — currently in phase 2
- **Recession Signal:** Hours typically lead payroll declines by 2-4 months
- **Watch:** Persistent hours weakness with stable employment = imminent layoffs

---

## SECTION II: GLOBAL MACRO INTELLIGENCE (MacroMicro)

### US LEIs vs. S&P 500 YoY%

**Leading Economic Indicators Diverging from Equities**

- **LEI Trend:** Conference Board LEI declining 6 consecutive months — recession probability rising
- **Equity Divergence:** S&P 500 near ATH while LEI falls — markets ignoring forward indicators
- **Historical Accuracy:** LEI predicted 8 of last 8 recessions with 6-9 month lead time
- **Components Weakening:** Building permits, consumer expectations, ISM new orders all declining
- **Risk:** Equity markets typically catch up to LEI eventually — current divergence unsustainable

---

### Global Semi Equipment Billings vs. Taiwan Exports

**AI/Chip Cycle Health Check**

- **Equipment Billings:** Record highs — semiconductor capex cycle intact
- **Taiwan Exports:** Up 30% YoY — TSMC/supply chain benefiting from AI GPU demand
- **Secular Tailwind:** AI infrastructure driving unprecedented chip demand
- **Forward-Looking:** Equipment orders today = production 6-12 months forward
- **Risk:** Any deceleration in billings would signal AI capex pause ahead

---

### US - Contribution of IT Investment to Change in Real GDP

**Tech Capex Supporting Growth**

- **IT Investment Share:** IT contributing ~0.5pp to GDP growth — material support to economy
- **AI Infrastructure:** Data center buildouts, GPU purchases driving IT capex surge
- **Sustainability:** Depends on continued AI adoption by enterprises
- **Risk:** If hyperscaler capex slows, IT contribution to GDP would decline sharply

---

### US - Share of Companies Currently or Planning to Use AI

**AI Adoption Accelerating**

- **Current Adoption:** 55% of companies using or planning AI deployment
- **Secular Trend:** Adoption curve still early — far from saturation
- **Revenue Impact:** AI users report 10-15% efficiency gains on average

---

### Bitcoin - Average Mining Costs

**BTC Mining Economics Tightening**

- **Mining Profitability:** Compressed margins — miner capitulation risk if BTC <$40K
- **Hash Rate:** Difficulty adjustment keeping pace with price — equilibrium under pressure
- **Miner Selling:** When costs approach price, miners forced to sell holdings = supply pressure
- **Signal:** Sustained trading below mining cost historically marks BTC bottoms

---

**US Winning AI Talent War**

- **Talent Inflows:** US attracting AI researchers/engineers at accelerating rate
- **Competitive Advantage:** Talent concentration = innovation advantage (network effects)

**US AI Innovation Leadership**

- **Patent Share:** US accounts for 45% of global AI patents granted
- **China Rising:** China at 30% and climbing — closing gap but still trailing
- **Quality vs Quantity:** US patents tend to be higher-impact (more citations)
- **Forward Indicator:** Patent activity today = commercial products 2-3 years forward

---

---

### GS (Goldman Sachs)

**Investment Banking Recovery Play**

- **M&A/IPO Activity:** Picking up after 2-year drought — GS levered to capital markets

---

### MARA (Marathon Digital)
