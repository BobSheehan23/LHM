# 📊 THE CHARTBOOK FRIDAY — Week 45

**Lighthouse Macro | November 7th, 2025**

---

## 🔦 MACRO, ILLUMINATED.

Welcome to **The Chartbook Friday** — your weekly macro reconnaissance mission, distilled into 50+ charts across five thematic arcs.

This week's edition cuts through the noise on growth deceleration, monetary plumbing dynamics, and a coiling volatility regime.

---

## 🧭 Lead Summary

**1. Growth Moderating, Labor Cooling**
Real GDP growth decelerating as final sales soften. Labor market showing cracks beneath the surface: JOLTS quits collapsing, Sahm Rule creeping higher, and long-term unemployment rising. Core headline: resilience, not strength.

**2. Monetary Plumbing: RRP Bleed Continues, Reserves Elevated**
ON RRP continues its grind lower from peak levels, while bank reserves remain ample. Fed balance sheet runoff (QT) proceeding on autopilot. Funding spreads benign; collateral markets functioning normally. Liquidity Index: **+0.62 (Easing bias)**.

**3. Markets: Concentration Risk High, Vol Regime Shifting**
S&P 500 holding near 6,730 with VIX compressed in the high teens. Equity-rates correlation shifting as MOVE (bond vol) decouples from VIX. Credit spreads contained (HY OAS ~300bps), but concentration in mega-cap tech remains a structural fragility.

### Chart 1: Sahm Rule Recession Indicator

The Sahm Rule—a reliable real-time recession signal—measures the 3-month moving average of unemployment relative to its 12-month low. When it crosses **0.5 percentage points**, recession risk is elevated.

**Current Reading:** Creeping higher but below threshold. Worth watching closely.

### Chart 2: ON RRP vs Bank Reserves

The Reverse Repo facility (RRP) has been bleeding consistently since its 2022 peak of $2.5T. As of latest data, RRP is near post-pandemic lows while **bank reserves have surged** to ~$3T—a key liquidity cushion.

**Takeaway:** Monetary plumbing normalized; no funding stress on the horizon.

### Chart 3: S&P 500 with Moving Averages

The S&P 500 continues to trade above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages—a technically constructive setup. However, **concentration risk** in the Magnificent 7 remains a structural concern.

**Latest:** SPX ~6,730 | 50-day support holding.

### Chart 4: 2s10s Yield Curve

The Treasury curve (2s10s) has been inverted for an extended period—historically a precursor to economic slowdowns. Recent steepening suggests either:
- Growth reacceleration expectations, OR
- Term premium repricing on fiscal concerns

**Current Spread:** Watching for sustained steepening as a regime shift signal.

### Chart 5: Labor Fragility Index (Proprietary)

Our **Labor Fragility Index** combines JOLTS quits, long-term unemployment, hours worked, and hires into a composite z-score. Rising fragility = labor market under stress.

**Current State:** Elevated (+0.60 z-score)
**Implication:** Softening labor dynamics beneath resilient headline payrolls.
