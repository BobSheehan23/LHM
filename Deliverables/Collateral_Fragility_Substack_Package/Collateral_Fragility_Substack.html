<h1>Collateral Fragility: How Stablecoins and Crypto Volatility Are Rewiring the U.S. Treasury Market</h1>
<p><em>August 19, 2025</em></p>

<h2>Introduction: Cracks in the Risk-Free Bedrock</h2>
<p>U.S. Treasuries have long served as the ultimate safe-haven asset and global collateral benchmark. But deep, structural shifts are undermining their foundation — including a retreat by foreign central banks, saturated dealer balance sheets, and an influx of price-sensitive, crypto-linked buyers.</p>

<h2>1. Demand Composition: The Decline of the Inelastic Buyer</h2>

<p>Foreign central banks’ share of Treasury holdings has dropped from 33% to 25%, replaced by domestic banks, dealers, and notably, stablecoin issuers — now 6% of the market. Unlike traditional buyers, stablecoin demand is tethered to volatile crypto flows, introducing procyclicality and liquidation risk.</p>

<h2>2. Dealer Constraints: Capacity Nearing the Limit</h2>
<img src="chart_dealer_balance_sheet_utilization.png" style="max-width:100%;">
<p>SLR utilization for primary dealers is at 95%. This regulatory ceiling means dealers are losing their ability to absorb issuance and provide liquidity — a key fragility in auction dynamics and secondary markets.</p>

<h2>3. Tailing Auctions: A Warning Sign</h2>
<img src="chart_treasury_auctions_tailing.png" style="max-width:100%;">
<p>The percentage of Treasury auctions tailing has climbed from 15% to 35%. This suggests structural demand weakness and growing difficulty in clearing supply without yield concessions.</p>

<h2>4. Term Premium Repricing</h2>
<img src="chart_term_premium_vs_stablecoin_holdings.png" style="max-width:100%;">
<p>A growing correlation between stablecoin T-bill holdings and the 10Y term premium indicates a bifurcated curve: short-end yields are suppressed by crypto demand, while the long end requires elevated risk premiums.</p>

<h2>5. Front-End Strength, Back-End Erosion</h2>
<img src="chart_bills_vs_bonds_coverage.png" style="max-width:100%;">
<p>Bid-to-cover ratios remain robust for T-bills (~3.2x) but are weakening for bonds (~2.4x). This divergence hides long-term risk beneath short-term strength — a fragile equilibrium.</p>

<h2>6. Collateral Stress Resembling 2019</h2>
<img src="chart_collateral_shortage_index.png" style="max-width:100%;">
<p>The Collateral Shortage Index has surged from 30 to 80 — echoing the mechanics that led to the 2019 repo crisis. It’s not credit risk this time, but pure mechanical dysfunction driven by balance sheet constraints.</p>

<h2>7. Repo Rates Linked to Crypto Flows</h2>
<img src="chart_repo_stress_vs_flows.png" style="max-width:100%;">
<p>Stablecoin redemptions now affect repo spreads. A large unwind in the crypto market could forcibly remove collateral from the system, tightening funding markets almost instantly.</p>

<h2>8. Volatility Spillover from Bitcoin to Bonds</h2>
<img src="chart_cross_asset_volatility.png" style="max-width:100%;">
<p>Bitcoin’s 80% volatility now has a transmission path to Treasuries via stablecoin reserves. What happens in crypto no longer stays in crypto.</p>

<h2>9. A Widening Structural Imbalance</h2>
<img src="chart_treasury_issuance_vs_demand.png" style="max-width:100%;">
<p>Treasury issuance is projected to far outpace “natural” demand. That means increasing reliance on yield-sensitive buyers — with higher volatility and borrowing costs baked in.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A New Collateral Regime Has Arrived</h2>
<p>We are no longer in a world where Treasuries are anchored by price-insensitive sovereigns and deep dealer balance sheets. The new Treasury buyer base is fractured, fast-moving, and procyclical.</p>
