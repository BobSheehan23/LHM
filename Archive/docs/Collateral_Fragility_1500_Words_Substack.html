<h1>Collateral Fragility: How Stablecoins and Crypto Volatility Are Rewiring the U.S. Treasury Market</h1>
<p><em>August 19, 2025</em></p>

<h2>Introduction: Cracks in the Risk-Free Bedrock</h2>
<p>U.S. Treasuries have long been the cornerstone of global finance, but structural shifts are undermining that foundation. The retreat of foreign central banks, strained dealer capacity, and the rise of stablecoin issuers introduce a fragile new dynamic—one that connects digital asset volatility to the deepest funding markets.</p>

<h2>1. Evolving Demand Composition</h2>

<p>Foreign central banks' share of Treasury holdings has fallen from 33% to 25%. In their place, domestic banks and stablecoin issuers have grown, with the latter now representing 6% of holdings. Unlike traditional buyers, stablecoin demand is tied to volatile crypto flows, introducing procyclical behavior and potential liquidation risks under stress.</p>

<h2>2. Dealer Constraints Are Binding</h2>

<p>Primary dealers—key intermediaries—are nearing the Supplementary Leverage Ratio limit (95% utilization). This reduces their ability to absorb new issuance or maintain market liquidity, increasing the risk of dislocations.</p>

<h2>3. Auctions Under Pressure</h2>

<p>The share of tailing auctions has more than doubled, rising to 35%. This indicates increasing difficulty in clearing supply, driven by weaker structural demand. Persistent tailing raises the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government.</p>

<h2>4. A Splintered Yield Curve</h2>

<p>As stablecoin demand concentrates on T-bills, the long end of the curve is left unsupported. This bifurcation has led to a rising term premium, with 10Y yields reflecting duration risk without a deep buyer base.</p>

<h2>5. Coverage Divergence</h2>

<p>Bid-to-cover ratios are strong for bills (~3.2x) but weak for bonds (~2.4x). This masks underlying demand fragility and signals that risk appetite is thinning further out the curve.</p>

<h2>6. Collateral Constraints Reemerge</h2>

<p>The Collateral Shortage Index has surged from 30 to 80—echoing pre-2019 repo crisis conditions. With dealer balance sheets full, the system is vulnerable to mechanical funding constraints, even without credit stress.</p>

<h2>7. Repo Volatility: Crypto in the Plumbing</h2>
<img src="chart_repo_stress_vs_flows.png">
<p>Stablecoin flows are now correlated with repo market stress. When stablecoins are redeemed, Treasury holdings are liquidated, reducing collateral and tightening funding—tying repo dynamics to digital asset sentiment.</p>

<h2>8. Cross-Asset Volatility Channel</h2>

<p>Bitcoin’s 80% volatility now has a direct conduit into the Treasury market via stablecoin reserves. This creates a novel, exogenous risk factor in what was once the global safe asset class.</p>

<h2>9. Issuance-Demand Imbalance</h2>

<p>Future issuance is set to far outpace “natural” demand. Reliance on yield-sensitive buyers increases funding volatility and raises the cost of capital. The structural imbalance is becoming entrenched.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Fragile New Regime</h2>
<p>The U.S. Treasury market has entered a regime defined by fragmented demand, dealer constraints, and crypto-linked volatility. Investors and policymakers must now treat digital asset flows and market plumbing stress as central inputs—not peripheral noise—in assessing sovereign credit market stability.</p>
