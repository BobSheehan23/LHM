# Protocol Treasury Advisory Outreach Protocol

## PRIORITY: TIER 1 - EXECUTE IN PARALLEL WITH TANIA
**Expected Timeline to Close:** 14-30 days per protocol  
**Revenue Potential:** $6,000/quarter per protocol ($2,000/month effective)  
**Volume Strategy:** Target 10 protocols, expect 1-3 conversions  
**Aggregate Revenue Potential:** $6,000-18,000/month if 3 convert

---

## STRATEGIC RATIONALE

**Why protocols need macro advisory:**
- Treasuries range from $50M-$5B (sufficient budget for professional advisory)
- Most lack systematic macro frameworks for deployment decisions
- Operate reactively (deploy when yields look good, panic-exit during drawdowns)
- Governance structures allow rapid decision-making (no multi-layer corporate approval)
- Increasing sophistication around treasury optimization (active governance discussions)

**Your differentiation:**
- Institutional macro rigor applied to crypto-native treasury management
- Systematic framework prevents emotional capital allocation
- Cross-asset regime analysis most protocols don't have internal capacity for
- Code-first, reproducible methodology aligns with protocol transparency values

---

## TARGET PROTOCOL CRITERIA

**Must-Have Characteristics:**
- Treasury size: $50M+ (sufficient budget for advisory spend)
- Active governance: Recent proposals around treasury management
- Public communication: Accessible treasury committee or finance leads
- Established legitimacy: Top 100 by TVL or market cap

**Nice-to-Have:**
- Explicit yield optimization focus (governance discussions about earning on treasury)
- Institutional partnerships (signals sophistication and budget)
- Growth phase (expanding operations = increasing treasury management complexity)

## STANDARD OUTREACH TEMPLATE

**Use this as base, personalize with protocol-specific angles from above**

### EMAIL SUBJECT LINE

```
Macro Intelligence for [Protocol] Treasury Optimization
```

### EMAIL BODY

```
[Treasury Lead Name / Governance Forum],

I run Lighthouse Macro, an institutional macro research platform serving hedge funds and digital asset allocators. I'm exploring advisory engagements with protocols managing substantial treasuries who need systematic macro frameworks for treasury deployment decisions.

SPECIFIC VALUE PROPOSITION

Quarterly macro advisory focused on treasury management optimization:

• Macro Regime Assessment: Growth/inflation/liquidity cycle positioning and implications for treasury deployment timing

• Yield Strategy Recommendations: When to deploy treasury capital into DeFi yield vs. maintain liquidity buffers based on cross-asset regime analysis

• Risk Monitoring: Cross-asset correlation shifts, tail risk events, deleveraging early warning signals

• Capital Allocation Framework: Systematic decision architecture for treasury diversification and risk-adjusted return optimization

DELIVERABLES & PRICING

$6,000 per quarter
• Quarterly macro intelligence brief (20-30 pages) tailored to [Protocol]'s treasury composition and deployment strategy
• One 60-minute strategy call per quarter with treasury committee
• Ad-hoc risk alerts for major regime shifts or deleveraging events

WHY PROTOCOLS NEED SYSTEMATIC MACRO FRAMEWORKS

Most treasury management operates reactively—deploy capital when yields look attractive, panic-exit during drawdowns, miss optimal entry/exit timing due to noise-driven decision-making. Systematic macro framework prevents emotional capital allocation and optimizes long-term risk-adjusted returns.

CASE STUDY

Early October analysis identified Treasury auction stress as leading indicator for crypto deleveraging event. Protocols that reduced risk exposure 2-3 weeks before deleveraging preserved capital while maintaining redeployment optionality for post-deleveraging entry points. Those who deployed at peak yields experienced 15-20% drawdown on treasury positions.

[PROTOCOL-SPECIFIC PERSONALIZATION FROM ABOVE]

Would this framework add value to [Protocol]'s treasury operations? Happy to provide sample research demonstrating the analytical approach or discuss customization for [Protocol]'s specific treasury composition.

Best,

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

### If No Response After 5 Days (First Follow-Up)

```
[Name / Forum],

Following up on treasury advisory proposal I sent last [day]. Wanted to flag one additional element potentially relevant for [Protocol]:

I'm currently building proprietary dashboards integrating:
• Traditional macro indicators (Fed policy, Treasury market stress)
• Crypto funding market dynamics (perpetual funding, basis)  
• On-chain correlation signals (stablecoin flows, accumulation patterns)

Early beta access available for advisory clients—provides real-time regime shift signals rather than retrospective analysis.

Would this framework interest [Protocol]'s treasury operations? Happy to walk through analytical approach if timing works.

Best,
Bob
```

### If No Response After 10 Days (Second Follow-Up)

```
[Name / Forum],

Last follow-up on this—I realize timing might not be right for structured advisory engagement, which is fine.

Alternative: Would [Protocol] find value in one-off custom research piece demonstrating macro framework applied to your treasury composition?

Something like: "[Protocol] Treasury Optimization: Q4 2025 Macro Regime Analysis and Capital Deployment Recommendations" (15-20 pages, delivered within 7 days, $3,000 flat fee).

Low-commitment way to evaluate analytical approach before exploring ongoing engagement.

Let me know if interesting—otherwise happy to revisit when treasury management becomes higher priority.

Best,
Bob
```

### If No Response After 14 Days

**Action:** Deprioritize this protocol, move to reserve list, focus on protocols showing engagement

## QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS (Once They Respond)

**Ask These to Determine Fit:**

1. "What's your current process for making treasury deployment decisions? Governance votes, working group recommendations, foundation discretion?"
   - **Why:** Reveals decision-making structure and timeline

2. "What does your treasury composition look like currently? Mostly stables, mix of tokens, DeFi positions?"
   - **Why:** Determines how to customize research deliverables

3. "Are there specific macro risks or deployment timing questions you're trying to solve for?"
   - **Why:** Lets you tailor framework to their exact pain points

4. "What's your timeline for bringing on advisory services? Do you need governance approval or can treasury working group contract directly?"
   - **Why:** Clarifies path to close and cash flow timing

5. "What does your current research stack look like for macro analysis?"
   - **Why:** Shows competitive landscape and differentiation opportunity

---

## PRICING FLEXIBILITY FRAMEWORK

| Their Response | Your Counter |
|---------------|-------------|
| "$6k/quarter works" | Lock at $6k, over-deliver on quality |
| "$6k is high for quarterly" | Offer semi-annual at $10k ($1,667/month effective) |
| "Can we start with one-off project?" | $3k one-off brief, convert to quarterly after proof of value |
| "Budget is $3-4k per quarter" | Accept $4k if they're Tier 1 protocol (MakerDAO, Uniswap, Arbitrum) |
| "What about monthly instead of quarterly?" | $2,500/month for monthly brief + monthly 30-min call |

**Never go below $3k/quarter—below that, opportunity cost isn't worth it**

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

**Objection:** "We have internal research capacity"  
**Response:** "Totally understand—most sophisticated protocols do. The value isn't replacing internal analysis, it's providing external cross-asset perspective that's tough to build internally when team is focused on protocol-specific operations. Think of it as insurance against blind spots rather than replacement for existing process."

**Objection:** "How do we know macro analysis actually helps treasury performance?"  
**Response:** "Fair question. Here's concrete example: Protocol treasuries that deployed heavily into DeFi yield in August-September 2024 experienced 15-20% drawdowns when deleveraging hit in October. Macro framework flagged Treasury auction stress 3 weeks early as leading indicator for crypto funding stress. That signal allowed repositioning before drawdown. Sample research demonstrates methodology—happy to share so you can evaluate predictive framework."

**Objection:** "We need governance approval which takes time"  
**Response:** "No problem—most protocols have 2-4 week governance cycles. Here's what I suggest: I'll provide sample research demonstrating analytical framework. You can circulate to treasury working group and include in governance proposal if valuable. That way governance vote is informed by concrete deliverable rather than abstract proposal."

**Objection:** "Can we get discount if we commit to 6-12 months upfront?"  
**Response:** "Absolutely—happy to offer annual prepay discount. $20,000 for full year (saves $4,000 vs. quarterly payments). Provides budget certainty for you, cash flow stability for me."

---

## CONTRACT EXECUTION (Once They Commit)

**Simple Agreement Structure:**

1. Services: Quarterly macro brief + strategy call + ad-hoc alerts
2. Term: Quarterly renewal (auto-renews unless canceled 30 days before quarter end)
3. Payment: Due at start of quarter (NET-15 terms for crypto payments)
4. Crypto payment accepted: USDC, USDT, DAI on Ethereum or Polygon
5. IP: You retain ownership, protocol gets non-exclusive license for internal use only

**Payment Address Setup:**
- Create dedicated wallet for business income (separate from personal)
- Provide multiple chain options (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum for lower gas)
- Accept payment in stables only (no native tokens—eliminates volatility risk)

**Use Bonsai or PandaDoc for E-Signature:**
- Simple 2-page agreement sufficient
- E-signature makes execution fast (crypto native protocols comfortable with this)

---

## FIRST DELIVERABLE STRATEGY (MAXIMIZE RETENTION)

**Brief Structure for First Quarter:**

1. **Executive Summary (1-2 pages):** Bottom-line deployment recommendations
2. **Macro Regime Assessment (5-7 pages):** Growth/inflation/liquidity cycle analysis
3. **Crypto Funding Market Analysis (5-7 pages):** Perpetual funding, basis, stablecoin flows
4. **Cross-Asset Correlation Dynamics (3-5 pages):** BTC/ETH correlation to SPX, bonds, dollar
5. **Yield Opportunity Analysis (3-5 pages):** Traditional vs. DeFi yield comparison by risk-adjusted return
6. **Protocol-Specific Recommendations (2-3 pages):** Tailored to their treasury composition
7. **Tail Risk Scenarios (2-3 pages):** What could break base case assumptions

**Customization by Protocol:**
- MakerDAO/Sky: Focus on stablecoin collateral implications
- Uniswap: Emphasize liquidity provision yield vs. treasury deployment tradeoffs  
- Arbitrum/Optimism: Connect L2 adoption cycles to broader crypto capital flows
- Aave: Deep dive on DeFi lending rate transmission from traditional policy
- Lido: Staking yield analysis relative to traditional rates environment

**Quality Markers:**
- Custom charts (not generic screenshots)
- Proprietary calculations showing methodology
- Specific action recommendations (not vague "monitor conditions")
- Risk quantification where possible (scenario probabilities, expected returns)

**Goal:** Protocol treasury working group thinks "This is significantly more sophisticated than what we could produce internally" within 48 hours of receiving first brief.

## SUCCESS METRICS & PROBABILITY ANALYSIS

**Per-Protocol Conversion Probability:**
- **15-20% aggregate conversion rate** across 10 protocols = 1.5-2 conversions expected
- **Best case:** 3 protocols convert = $18,000/quarter = $6,000/month recurring
- **Realistic case:** 2 protocols convert = $12,000/quarter = $4,000/month recurring
- **Conservative case:** 1 protocol converts = $6,000/quarter = $2,000/month recurring

**Timeline Expectations:**
- Week 1-2: Initial outreach and engagement
- Week 3-4: Follow-ups and qualification calls
- Week 5-6: Proposal circulation and governance discussions
- Week 7-8: Contract execution and first payment

**First payment expected:** 30-60 days from initial outreach for fastest-moving protocols

---

## RESERVE TARGET LIST (If Initial 10 Don't Convert)

**Tier 2 Protocols:**
- Synthetix ($200M+ treasury)
- Curve ($300M+ treasury)
- Balancer ($100M+ treasury)
- Frax Finance ($200M+ treasury)
- Rocket Pool ($150M+ treasury)

**Deploy these only if Tier 1 list shows poor response rates (<10% engagement)**

---

## EXECUTION CHECKLIST

**Today (Sunday):**
- [ ] Send MakerDAO/Sky outreach via governance forum
- [ ] Send Uniswap outreach via governance forum + Twitter DM to foundation

**Monday:**
- [ ] Send Arbitrum outreach  
- [ ] Send Optimism outreach

---

## PARALLEL EXECUTION NOTE

**Critical:** Don't wait for responses before sending next wave. Volume strategy requires parallel outreach across all 10 protocols within 7-10 days.

Protocol sales cycles are long (governance processes, committee discussions), so you need multiple prospects in pipeline simultaneously. One conversion out of 10 outreach attempts is success—but you only get that if you execute full volume strategy.
