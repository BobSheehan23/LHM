# Collateral Fragility: How Stablecoins and Crypto Volatility Are Rewiring the U.S. Treasury Market

**Date:** August 19, 2025

## Introduction: Cracks in the Risk-Free Bedrock

U.S. Treasuries have long served as the ultimate safe-haven asset and global collateral benchmark. But deep, structural shifts are undermining their foundation — including a retreat by foreign central banks, saturated dealer balance sheets, and an influx of price-sensitive, crypto-linked buyers.

## 1. Demand Composition: The Decline of the Inelastic Buyer

Foreign central banks’ share of Treasury holdings has dropped from 33% to 25%, replaced by domestic banks, dealers, and notably, stablecoin issuers — now 6% of the market. Unlike traditional buyers, stablecoin demand is tethered to volatile crypto flows, introducing procyclicality and liquidation risk.

## 2. Dealer Constraints: Capacity Nearing the Limit

SLR utilization for primary dealers is at 95%. This regulatory ceiling means dealers are losing their ability to absorb issuance and provide liquidity — a key fragility in auction dynamics and secondary markets.

## 3. Tailing Auctions: A Warning Sign

The percentage of Treasury auctions tailing has climbed from 15% to 35%. This suggests structural demand weakness and growing difficulty in clearing supply without yield concessions.

## 4. Term Premium Repricing

A growing correlation between stablecoin T-bill holdings and the 10Y term premium indicates a bifurcated curve: short-end yields are suppressed by crypto demand, while the long end requires elevated risk premiums.

## 5. Front-End Strength, Back-End Erosion

Bid-to-cover ratios remain robust for T-bills (~3.2x) but are weakening for bonds (~2.4x). This divergence hides long-term risk beneath short-term strength — a fragile equilibrium.

## 6. Collateral Stress Resembling 2019

The Collateral Shortage Index has surged from 30 to 80 — echoing the mechanics that led to the 2019 repo crisis. It’s not credit risk this time, but pure mechanical dysfunction driven by balance sheet constraints.

## 7. Repo Rates Linked to Crypto Flows

Stablecoin redemptions now affect repo spreads. A large unwind in the crypto market could forcibly remove collateral from the system, tightening funding markets almost instantly.

## 8. Volatility Spillover from Bitcoin to Bonds

Bitcoin’s 80% volatility now has a transmission path to Treasuries via stablecoin reserves. What happens in crypto no longer stays in crypto.

---

## 9. A Widening Structural Imbalance

Treasury issuance is projected to far outpace “natural” demand. That means increasing reliance on yield-sensitive buyers — with higher volatility and borrowing costs baked in.

---

## Conclusion: A New Collateral Regime Has Arrived

We are no longer in a world where Treasuries are anchored by price-insensitive sovereigns and deep dealer balance sheets. The new Treasury buyer base is fractured, fast-moving, and procyclical.
