# LIGHTHOUSE MACRO - ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS & METHODOLOGIES

**Institutional-Grade Macro Intelligence Architecture**

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

**"Macro, Illuminated."**

The Lighthouse Macro framework is built on three foundational pillars:

1. **Regime Identification** - Where are we in the macro cycle?
2. **Transmission Mechanisms** - How does policy/liquidity transmit to markets?
3. **Early Warning Signals** - What vulnerabilities are building?

---

## FRAMEWORK 1: ECONOMIC REGIME CLASSIFICATION

### The Four Quadrants of Macro Regimes

**Axes:**

- X-Axis: Real GDP Growth (%)
- Y-Axis: Core Inflation (% YoY)

**Quadrants:**

```
                High Inflation
                      │
    STAGFLATION       │     OVERHEATING
  (Worst for Risk)   │   (Late Cycle)
         ◄────────────┼────────────►
 Low Growth           │           High Growth
         ◄────────────┼────────────►
    RECESSION         │     GOLDILOCKS
   (Risk-Off)         │   (Best for Risk)
                      │
                 Low Inflation
```

**Trading Implications:**

- **Goldilocks** (High Growth, Low Inflation): Long equities, short volatility, risk-on
- **Overheating** (High Growth, High Inflation): Commodities, inflation protection, Fed tightening imminent
- **Stagflation** (Low Growth, High Inflation): Worst quadrant - cash, gold, defensive
- **Recession** (Low Growth, Low Inflation): Treasuries, quality defensives, Fed easing

**Key Indicators:**

- GDP Growth (quarterly)
- Core PCE Inflation (monthly)
- Employment growth
- ISM Manufacturing & Services

---

## FRAMEWORK 2: THE PHILLIPS CURVE - LABOR VS INFLATION

### Unemployment vs Core Inflation Dynamics

**Theory:**
Low unemployment → Wage pressure → Inflation
High unemployment → Wage slack → Disinflation

**Fed Policy Response:**

- **Below NAIRU + High Inflation** → Aggressive tightening
- **Above NAIRU + Low Inflation** → Easing bias
- **Flat/Vertical Phillips Curve** → Structural inflation changes

**Chart Methodology:**

- X-Axis: Unemployment Rate (%)
- Y-Axis: Core CPI (% YoY)
- Color: Time dimension (recent = hot colors)
- Fed 2% target line (horizontal)
- NAIRU estimate line (vertical, ~4.0%)

**Trading Signal:**

- **Moving toward upper-left** (low unemployment, high inflation) = Fed hawkish, risk-off
- **Moving toward lower-right** (high unemployment, low inflation) = Fed dovish, risk-on

---

## FRAMEWORK 3: YIELD CURVE ANALYSIS

### A. Yield Curve Shape

**Normal Curve (Upward Sloping):**

- 30Y > 10Y > 5Y > 2Y
- Healthy economy
- Banks profitable (borrow short, lend long)
- Risk-on environment

**Flat Curve:**

- 10Y ≈ 2Y
- Transition period
- Fed near terminal rate
- Uncertainty building

**Inverted Curve:**

- 2Y > 10Y (most important)
- Recession signal (historically 6-18 months ahead)
- Fed overtightening
- Risk-off, defensives outperform

### B. Yield Curve Spreads as Recession Predictor

**Key Spreads:**

1. **10Y-2Y Spread** (Most watched)

   - Inversion threshold: < 0 bps
   - Recession probability increases significantly after inversion + un-inversion

2. **10Y-3M Spread** (NY Fed preferred)
   - More accurate recession predictor
   - Used in NY Fed Recession Probability Model

**Chart Methodology:**

- Dual-axis: 10Y-2Y (primary), 10Y-3M (secondary)
- Recession shading (NBER dates)
- Zero line (inversion threshold)
- Current spread vs historical distribution

---

## FRAMEWORK 4: INFLATION DECOMPOSITION

### Three-Layer Inflation Analysis

**Layer 1: Headline vs Core**

- **Headline CPI** - Includes food & energy (volatile)
- **Core CPI** - Excludes food & energy (Fed's focus)
- **Core PCE** - Fed's official target (2% long-term)

**Layer 2: Components**

- **Goods Inflation** - Supply chains, manufacturing, tariffs
- **Services Inflation** - Wage-driven, stickier, ~60% of basket
- **Shelter/Housing** - Largest component, lags 12-18 months

**Layer 3: Drivers**

- **Demand-Pull** - Overheating economy, excess money supply
- **Cost-Push** - Supply shocks (oil, supply chains)
- **Wage-Price Spiral** - Self-reinforcing (most dangerous)

**Disinflation Framework:**

- **Phase 1: Goods Disinflation** (supply chains normalize) ✓ Done
- **Phase 2: Services Disinflation** (labor market cools) ← We are here
- **Phase 3: Shelter Disinflation** (rent normalization lags) ← Next

**Trading Signal:**

- Core CPI trending toward 2% = Fed pivot approaching
- Core PCE > 3% sustained = Fed stays higher for longer
- Wage growth > productivity growth = Inflation sticky

---

## FRAMEWORK 5: LABOR MARKET HEALTH - JOLTS FRAMEWORK

### The Labor Market Flow Dynamics

**Key Indicators:**

1. **Job Openings (Demand)**

   - High openings = tight labor market
   - Openings/Unemployed ratio (Beveridge Curve)

2. **Hires (Activity)**

   - Actual hiring happening
   - Lags openings (hiring friction)

3. **Quits (Worker Confidence)**

   - High quits = workers confident, can find better job
   - "Great Resignation" indicator
   - Correlated with wage growth

4. **Layoffs (Stress)**
   - Rising layoffs = deteriorating conditions
   - Leading recession indicator

**Beveridge Curve:**

- X-Axis: Unemployment Rate
- Y-Axis: Job Openings Rate (% of labor force)
- **Outward shift** = Labor market mismatch (structural issues)
- **Movement along curve** = Cyclical changes
- **Inward movement** = Labor market normalizing

**Trading Signal:**

- High openings + low unemployment + high quits = Wage pressure → Inflation → Fed hikes
- Rising layoffs + falling quits = Recession risk → Risk-off

---

## FRAMEWORK 6: THE RRP - LIQUIDITY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM

### Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) as Liquidity Gauge

**Mechanics:**

- Money Market Funds (MMFs) park cash at Fed overnight
- Earns RRP rate (currently ~5.3%)
- Alternative to T-Bills, bank deposits

**Why It Matters:**

**High RRP ($2T+ peak):**

- Excess liquidity in system
- MMFs can't find better alternatives
- Banks don't need deposits (QT era)
- Liquidity "parked" at Fed, not in markets

**RRP Drawdown:**

- Liquidity draining FROM Fed TO markets
- Could be:
  - **Bullish** - Cash entering risk assets, T-Bill supply absorption
  - **Bearish** - Funding stress, banks need deposits, liquidity crisis

**RRP vs VIX Relationship:**

- **Inverse correlation historically** (high RRP = low vol)
- **Breakdown of correlation** = Liquidity transmission broken
- **RRP depletion + rising VIX** = Major warning signal

**Chart Methodology:**

- Dual-axis: RRP Usage ($B, primary) vs VIX (secondary)
- Correlation windows
- Threshold levels ($500B = critical low)

---

## FRAMEWORK 7: CREDIT CYCLE - CORPORATE LEVERAGE & SPREADS

### High-Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (HY OAS)

**What It Measures:**

- Excess yield of high-yield bonds over Treasuries
- "Junk bond" credit risk premium
- Market's pricing of default risk

**Key Levels:**

- **< 300 bps** - Extremely tight, complacency, late cycle
- **300-500 bps** - Normal conditions
- **500-800 bps** - Elevated stress
- **> 1000 bps** - Crisis conditions (2008, 2020 COVID)

**HY OAS + Investment Grade Spread:**

- **BBB-AAA Spread** - Quality spread within IG
- Widening = Flight to quality
- **HY-IG Differential** - Relative value

**Credit Cycle Stages:**

```
1. EXPANSION
   - Spreads tightening
   - Easy lending standards
   - Corporate leverage rising
   - M&A, buybacks accelerating

2. PEAK
   - Spreads at lows
   - Maximum complacency
   - Covenant-lite loans prevalent
   - "Zombie companies" proliferating

3. DETERIORATION
   - Spreads widening
   - Lending standards tightening
   - Downgrades accelerating
   - Fed tightening biting

4. CRISIS
   - Spreads blow out (>1000 bps)
   - Credit markets freeze
   - Defaults spike
   - Fed intervention required
```

**Trading Signal:**

- HY OAS < 300 bps = Late cycle, reduce credit exposure
- HY OAS > 800 bps = Distressed opportunities, but be patient
- Rising HY OAS + flat equity vol = Divergence, credit leading

---

## FRAMEWORK 8: EXCESS BOND PREMIUM (EBP)

### Policy Transmission to Credit Markets

**What Is EBP?**

- Credit spread ABOVE what default risk alone justifies
- Measures market's risk appetite / aversion
- Calculated by Fed researchers (Gilchrist-Zakrajšek)

**Formula (Conceptual):**

```
Corporate Spread = Default Risk Premium + Excess Bond Premium
                   (Justified by fundamentals)  (Risk aversion)
```

**Why It Matters:**

- **High EBP** = Market demands extra compensation beyond defaults

  - Credit conditions tight
  - Risk-off
  - Financial stress building

- **Low EBP** = Market accepting low compensation
  - Credit conditions easy
  - Risk-on
  - Potentially complacent

**EBP vs Fed Funds:**

- **Fed hiking + EBP rising** = Policy tightening working, credit conditions tightening
- **Fed hiking + EBP falling** = Policy NOT transmitting, "Fed put" still in effect
- **Fed cutting + EBP spiking** = Crisis mode, Fed behind curve

---

## FRAMEWORK 9: CREDIT IMPULSE

### Leading Indicator of Economic Activity

**Definition:**

- **Credit Impulse** = Change in credit growth rate
- NOT level of credit, NOT growth rate, but ACCELERATION

**Formula:**

```
Credit Growth = (Total Credit / GDP) YoY change
Credit Impulse = Δ(Credit Growth)
```

**Why It Leads:**

- Credit growth accelerating → More spending/investment → GDP growth ahead
- Credit growth decelerating → Less spending → GDP slowdown ahead
- Leads GDP by ~6-9 months

**Interpretation:**

- **Positive Credit Impulse** = Credit accelerating

  - Bullish for growth
  - Bullish for risk assets
  - Cyclicals outperform

- **Negative Credit Impulse** = Credit decelerating
  - Bearish for growth
  - Shift to defensives
  - Leading recession indicator

**Chart Methodology:**

- Single axis: Credit Impulse (% of GDP)
- Zero line (critical threshold)
- Shade positive (green) vs negative (red)
- Overlay GDP growth (lagged)

---

## FRAMEWORK 10: MONEY MARKET PLUMBING - SOFR, EFFR, OBFR

### The Fed's Operational Framework

**Three Key Rates:**

1. **SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)**

   - Secured (backed by Treasuries)
   - Repo market rate
   - Replaced LIBOR
   - Volume: ~$1T daily

2. **EFFR (Effective Federal Funds Rate)**

   - Unsecured (bank-to-bank lending)
   - Fed's primary target rate
   - Volume: ~$100B daily

3. **OBFR (Overnight Bank Funding Rate)**
   - Broader unsecured rate
   - Includes Fed Funds + Eurodollar

**Spread Dynamics:**

**Normal Conditions:**

```
OBFR ≈ EFFR < SOFR
(Unsecured rates slightly above secured)
```

**Stress Conditions:**

```
SOFR >> EFFR/OBFR
(Secured funding premium - collateral flight)
```

**SOFR-EFFR Spread as Stress Indicator:**

- **< 5 bps** - Normal, ample liquidity
- **5-10 bps** - Minor stress
- **> 15 bps** - Funding stress (Sept 2019 repo crisis = 300 bps spike)

**Trading Signal:**

- SOFR-EFFR widening = Repo market stress → Risk-off
- OBFR-EFFR widening = Bank funding stress → Financial conditions tightening

---

## FRAMEWORK 11: DEALER POSITIONING & TREASURY MARKET FUNCTION

### Primary Dealer Inventory as Liquidity Gauge

**Who Are Primary Dealers?**

- 24 banks/brokers authorized to trade with NY Fed
- Market makers in Treasuries
- Required to participate in Treasury auctions

**Dealer Positioning Signals:**

**Large Long Position (Dealers own lots of Treasuries):**

- Warehousing supply
- Risk: Dealers may need to offload
- Vulnerable to rate sell-off

**Large Short Position (Dealers short Treasuries):**

- Facilitating client demand
- Potential short squeeze
- Bullish for Treasuries

**Net Zero / Small Position:**

- Efficient market functioning
- Good liquidity
- Low stress

**Chart Methodology:**

- Net Dealer Position by maturity (Bills, Notes, Bonds)
- Zero line
- Historical extremes (±$100B+ = extreme)

---

## FRAMEWORK 12: SWAP SPREADS

### Interbank Credit Health & Basis Trade Capacity

**What Is a Swap Spread?**

```
Swap Spread = Swap Rate - Treasury Yield
              (Same maturity)
```

**Example:**

- 10Y Swap Rate: 4.50%
- 10Y Treasury: 4.30%
- 10Y Swap Spread: +20 bps

**Normal Positive Spread:**

- Swap = interbank credit risk
- Treasury = risk-free
- Positive spread reflects credit premium

**Negative Swap Spread (Anomaly):**

- Treasury yields > swap rates
- Happened in 2015-2016
- Reflects:
  - Treasury scarcity (QE reduced supply)
  - Dealer balance sheet constraints (post-2008 regulation)
  - Basis trade capacity limits

**Swap Spread Widening:**

- Interbank credit stress rising
- Bank funding costs increasing
- Liquidity deteriorating
- Risk-off signal

**Chart Methodology:**

- Multiple swap spreads: 2Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y
- Zero line (positive vs negative)
- Historical context (2008 crisis, 2016 negative spreads)

---

## FRAMEWORK 13: CROSS-CURRENCY BASIS SWAP

### Global Dollar Funding Stress Gauge

**What Is It?**

- Cost for non-USD entities to borrow dollars
- Swap foreign currency for USD, return at maturity
- Should be ~0 (covered interest parity) but often isn't

**EUR/USD 3M Basis:**

- **Negative basis** = Premium to borrow USD

  - Non-US banks/firms desperate for dollars
  - Dollar shortage globally
  - Crisis indicator (2008, 2020 = -100 bps+)

- **Positive basis** = Premium to borrow EUR
  - Rare, means dollar abundant

**JPY/USD Basis:**

- Japanese banks/institutions major dollar borrowers
- Negative basis = carry trade stress
- Widening = yen strength ahead (unwind carry)

**Trading Signals:**

- EUR/USD basis < -50 bps = Major dollar shortage → Risk-off, Fed swap lines likely
- Basis normalizing (→ 0) = Stress easing → Risk-on
- Basis + VIX correlation = Global stress confirmation

---

## FRAMEWORK 14: STABLECOIN SUPPLY AS CRYPTO LIQUIDITY

### Stablecoins as "Dry Powder" for Crypto Markets

**Key Stablecoins:**

1. **USDT (Tether)** - Largest, ~$80B
2. **USDC (Circle)** - Regulated, ~$25B
3. **DAI (MakerDAO)** - Decentralized, ~$5B

**Stablecoin Supply Dynamics:**

**Rising Supply:**

- New capital entering crypto
- "Dry powder" on sidelines
- Historically precedes BTC rallies
- Bullish 3-6 month lead

**Falling Supply:**

- Capital leaving crypto
- Off-ramping to USD
- Bearish for crypto

**Stablecoin vs Bitcoin Price:**

- Stablecoin supply = ammunition
- BTC price = target
- **High correlation** = Healthy market
- **Divergence** (supply up, BTC flat) = Accumulation phase, bullish setup

---

## FRAMEWORK 15: STABLECOINS VS MONEY MARKET FUNDS

### Digital Dollar Competition

**The Competition:**

- **Stablecoins** - On-chain, 24/7, global, programmable
- **MMFs** - Traditional, regulated, institutional, ~$6T

**Why It Matters:**

- Stablecoins backed by Treasuries + repos (same as MMFs)
- Competing for same collateral
- Stablecoin growth = T-Bill demand
- Potential future: Stablecoins eat MMF market share

**Yield Comparison:**

- MMF yield: ~5.3% (follows Fed Funds)
- Stablecoin yield: 0% (USDT/USDC don't pay yield)
- **BUT:** DeFi protocols pay 4-8% on stablecoins

**Market Structure Implications:**

- Stablecoin supply growth → Structural T-Bill bid
- Stablecoin runs (depegging) → Money market contagion risk
- Regulatory clarity = unlock institutional adoption

---

## FRAMEWORK 16: BITCOIN REALIZED VOLATILITY VS VIX

### Crypto-Traditional Market Integration

**Realized Volatility:**

```
Realized Vol = Std Dev(Daily Returns) × √365 × 100
               (Annualized %)
```

**BTC 30-Day Realized Vol:**

- Typically 40-80% (vs equity ~15-25%)
- Mean-reverting
- Spikes during crashes/rallies

**BTC Vol vs VIX Comparison:**

**High Correlation Regime:**

- BTC trading like risk-on asset
- Crypto integrated with traditional markets
- "Risk-on/risk-off" driver

**Low Correlation Regime:**

- BTC trading on crypto-native factors
- Decoupled from traditional finance
- "Digital gold" narrative

**Convergence:**

- BTC vol declining over time (maturation)
- Still 2-3x equity vol
- Institutional adoption = further convergence

---

## FRAMEWORK 17: OFR FINANCIAL STRESS INDEX (FSI)

### System-Wide Stress Composite

**What Is FSI?**

- Office of Financial Research (OFR) composite index
- Combines 33 market-based indicators
- Standardized (mean = 0, std dev = 1)

**Components:**

1. **Credit** - Spreads, default risk
2. **Equity Valuation** - Volatility, valuations
3. **Funding** - Repo, LIBOR-OIS, TED spread
4. **Safe Assets** - Treasury yields, flight to quality
5. **FX** - Dollar strength, EM stress

**Interpretation:**

- **FSI < 0** - Below average stress (normal)
- **FSI = 0 to 1** - Moderate stress
- **FSI > 1** - Elevated stress (1 std dev above normal)
- **FSI > 2** - Severe stress (2008, 2020)

**Trading Signals:**

- FSI crossing 0 → 1 = Risk reduction, hedge
- FSI > 1.5 = Major de-risking, Fed intervention likely
- FSI declining from peaks = Risk-on recovery

---

## FRAMEWORK 18: NY FED RECESSION PROBABILITY MODEL

### 10Y-3M Spread as Recession Predictor

**Model:**

```
P(Recession in 12 months) = f(10Y - 3M Spread)
```

**Thresholds:**

- **< 10% probability** - Low risk
- **10-30%** - Elevated risk, monitor
- **30-50%** - High risk, position defensively
- **> 50%** - Recession likely within 12 months

**Historical Accuracy:**

- Predicted all recessions since 1960
- Few false positives
- Lead time: 6-18 months

**Limitations:**

- QE/QT distorts term premium
- "This time is different" trap
- Probability ≠ certainty

**Trading Strategy:**

- > 30% = Reduce cyclical exposure, add defensives
- > 50% = Recession portfolio (long duration, quality, gold)
- Declining from peak = Recovery positioning

---

## FRAMEWORK 19: LIQUIDITY COMPOSITE DASHBOARD

### Multi-Dimensional Liquidity Gauge

**Four Pillars of Liquidity:**

1. **Central Bank Liquidity**

   - Fed balance sheet
   - RRP facility usage
   - QE/QT pace

2. **Market Liquidity**

   - Bid-ask spreads
   - Treasury market depth
   - Dealer positioning

3. **Funding Liquidity**

   - SOFR-EFFR spread
   - Repo rates
   - TED spread (LIBOR-OIS)

4. **Private Liquidity**
   - M2 money supply growth
   - Bank credit growth
   - C&I loan growth

**Dashboard Approach:**

- 4 panels, each showing one pillar
- Traffic light system (green/yellow/red)
- Composite score (1-10)

**Interpretation:**

- **All green (8-10)** = Ample liquidity, risk-on
- **Mixed (5-7)** = Neutral, selective
- **All red (1-4)** = Liquidity crisis, extreme caution

---

## FRAMEWORK 20: CORPORATE LEVERAGE - DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

### Nonfinancial Corporate Debt to GDP

**What It Measures:**

- Corporate sector leverage relative to economic size
- Debt sustainability
- Potential deleveraging risk

**Key Levels:**

- **< 40%** - Low leverage, healthy
- **40-45%** - Moderate leverage
- **45-50%** - Elevated leverage
- **> 50%** - High leverage, vulnerable to rates

**Debt Service Coverage:**

- Interest expense / Operating income
- Rising rates = rising debt service
- Zombie companies (can't cover interest)

**Leverage Cycle:**

```
1. Low Leverage → Cheap credit → Borrow for growth/M&A
2. Rising Leverage → Credit spreads still tight
3. Peak Leverage → Rates rise, spreads widen
4. Deleveraging → Default/restructure/paydown
```

**Trading Signal:**

- Debt/GDP > 50% + Fed hiking = Credit risk rising
- Deleveraging cycle = Bearish equities, bullish HY distressed

---
