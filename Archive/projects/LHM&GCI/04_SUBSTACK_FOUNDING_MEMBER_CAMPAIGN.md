# Substack Founding Member Campaign Protocol

## PRIORITY: TIER 1 - LAUNCH TUESDAY
**Expected Timeline to Close:** 72-hour campaign window  
**Revenue Potential:** $3,000-30,000 immediate cash (5-50 conversions)  
**Probability Assessment:** 10-25% conversion rate on engaged free subscribers  
**Follow-On Impact:** Converts free readers to paying customers, establishes pricing psychology for future institutional tier

---

## STRATEGIC RATIONALE

**Why Founding Member Model Works:**

1. **Artificial scarcity creates urgency:** 72-hour window + 50-member cap = fear of missing out
2. **Massive discount justifies commitment:** $600/year vs. $1,800 institutional rate = 67% savings
3. **Identity positioning:** "Founding Member" is status signal, not charity ask
4. **Capital efficiency:** One-time upfront payment provides immediate cash for infrastructure
5. **Retention mechanism:** Rate lock guarantees creates long-term subscriber base
6. **Social proof engine:** Founding members become evangelists and testimonial sources

**Why This Timing:**
- You already have 500+ free subscribers (sufficient base for meaningful conversions)
- Recent podcast created engagement spike (warm audience)
- You need immediate cash to fund infrastructure decisions
- Creates revenue baseline before institutional tier launch

## EXACT EMAIL COPY - FOUNDING MEMBER LAUNCH

**Subject Line Options** (A/B test if Substack allows, otherwise use #1):

1. **Lighthouse Macro Founding Member Access—72-Hour Window**
2. **Why I'm Capping Lighthouse Macro at 50 Founding Members**
3. **The Economics of Independent Macro Research (And Your Role In It)**

**Email Body:**

```
Over the past six months, Lighthouse Macro has evolved from personal research documentation to institutional-grade macro intelligence consumed by hedge fund analysts, CIO offices, and central bank research teams.

As we formalize the institutional research model, I'm offering a limited founding member tier before transitioning to full institutional pricing.

THE INFRASTRUCTURE QUESTION

Running independent macro research means solving a structural problem: maintain institutional data quality (Bloomberg, premium vendors, proprietary infrastructure) without institutional capture (revenue pressure that dilutes research autonomy).

Most researchers solve this by going institutional (join a bank, get acquired by a fund, white-label for larger platforms). That path trades independence for capital.

I'm choosing the harder route: build sustainable independent infrastructure funded directly by research consumers who value transparency and analytical rigor.

FOUNDING MEMBER ECONOMICS

One-time payment: $600/year (locked rate indefinitely)
Standard institutional rate (launching Q1 2026): $1,800/year
Effective discount: 67% off institutional pricing, permanent rate lock

This isn't charity pricing—it's strategic positioning. Founding members provide the capital infrastructure that lets me build independent data systems (currently exploring FinTech Sandbox partnerships, MacroMicro integration, Bloomberg alternative architecture) without institutional capture.

You get institutional research quality at retail pricing. I get operational independence.

WHAT YOU'RE FUNDING

Your $600 funds:
• Independent data infrastructure (moving off Bloomberg Terminal dependence)
• Proprietary analytical tools (custom dashboards, real-time correlation signals)
• Expanded research capacity (deeper cross-asset analysis, more frequent tactical updates)
• Operational sustainability (no revenue pressure distorting research quality)

FOUNDING MEMBER BENEFITS

• Full research suite access (Beacon, Beam, Chartbook, Horizon—4 distinct research products per week)
• Quarterly strategy calls (60 minutes, max 20 participants, macro Q&A format with cross-asset positioning discussion)
• Priority access to institutional partnerships (upcoming: Global Capital Institute collaboration, proprietary data dashboard releases)
• Rate lock guarantee (your $600/year rate survives indefinitely, regardless of institutional pricing changes)
• Founding Member designation (acknowledged in research credits, community status)

THE CONSTRAINT

72-hour enrollment window closes Friday, November 1 at midnight EST.

Founding member cap: 50 members (funding $30,000 operational infrastructure buildout).
Current enrollments: 0/50

After Friday, only monthly institutional tier available ($149/month = $1,788/year).

WHY THE CAP

Two reasons:

First, operational capacity: Quarterly calls with 50 members is manageable. Quarterly calls with 500 members is impossible. First-mover advantage on community access.

Second, strategic positioning: Founding members are investors in independence, not customers buying commodity research. That relationship only works at limited scale.

THE ALTERNATIVE PATH

You don't have to be a founding member to consume Lighthouse Macro research. Starting next week, standard subscription tiers launch:

• Professional: $49/month ($588/year) — For sophisticated retail traders
• Institutional: $149/month ($1,788/year) — For hedge funds, allocators, advisors

But you won't get:
• Permanent rate lock (prices will increase as research quality and institutional adoption scale)
• Quarterly strategy calls (reserved for founding members)
• Priority access to new products (founding members get early beta access)

THE DECISION

This is infrastructure investment masquerading as research subscription. If you've found value in the free work, this is the mechanism to ensure it continues without institutional dilution.

If $600 annual commitment doesn't make sense right now, no problem—professional tier launching Monday is more flexible.

But if you value research independence and want to lock in institutional-grade analysis at retail pricing permanently, now is the only window.

[PAYMENT LINK - Substack Founding Member Subscription]

72 hours. 50 members. Permanent rate lock.

Best,
Bob Sheehan, CFA, CMT
Lighthouse Macro

P.S. — If you're thinking "I'll wait and see if this sells out before deciding", understand that's the default psychology. The 50-person cap is real. When it closes Friday at midnight, it's gone. I won't reopen founding member tier at any price—institutional tier pricing is the new floor.

## LANDING PAGE STRUCTURE (Substack Native)

**If Using Substack's Built-In Subscription Page:**

Substack lets you create custom subscription tiers. Set up Founding Member tier with these specifications:

**Tier Name:** Founding Member (Lifetime Rate Lock)

**Price:** $600/year (annual only, no monthly option)

**Description:**

```
LIMITED TO 50 MEMBERS — Closes November 1, 2025 at midnight EST

Founding Member tier provides permanent rate lock at $600/year (67% discount from $1,800 institutional rate launching Q1 2026).

Includes:
✓ Full research suite access (Beacon, Beam, Chartbook, Horizon)
✓ Quarterly strategy calls (60 min, 20-person max, macro Q&A)
✓ Priority access to institutional partnerships & data dashboards
✓ Founding Member designation in research credits
✓ Lifetime rate guarantee (your $600/year rate never increases)

This tier closes permanently after 50 members or November 1, 2025, whichever comes first.

After Friday, only Professional ($588/year) and Institutional ($1,788/year) tiers available, with no rate lock guarantees.
```

**If Using External Stripe Checkout:**

Create Stripe payment link with these settings:
- Product: Lighthouse Macro Founding Member (Annual Subscription)
- Price: $600/year
- Billing: Annual recurring (auto-renews at $600 unless you manually adjust later)
- Quantity limit: 50 maximum purchases
- Active: Enable immediately, disable after 50 sales or Friday midnight

## MID-CAMPAIGN URGENCY EMAIL (Send Wednesday if <10 Conversions)

**Subject:** 36 Hours Left — Founding Member Status Update

**Body:**

```
Quick update on Founding Member enrollment:

Current: 7/50 spots filled (as of Wednesday 2pm EST)
Remaining: 43 spots
Time left: 36 hours (closes Friday midnight)

If you're on the fence, here's what's helpful to know:

THE RATE LOCK IS REAL

Your $600/year rate is permanent. When institutional tier launches next week at $1,788/year, you're still at $600. When I raise institutional pricing to $2,400/year in 2026 (likely, given data infrastructure costs), you're still at $600.

Founding members lock in 2025 pricing for life.

THE QUARTERLY CALLS ARE VALUABLE

This isn't a generic webinar. It's 20 sophisticated investors and traders asking specific macro positioning questions. Last quarterly call I did (closed group, different context) covered:
• Fed policy path probabilities and implications for credit spreads
• Crypto funding market stress signals predicting deleveraging
• Emerging market capital flow dynamics affecting currency positioning

Founding member calls will be similar depth, similar format, capped at 20 participants to keep signal-to-noise ratio high.

THE CAP IS OPERATIONAL, NOT MARKETING

I'm not artificially capping this to create urgency. 50 founding members generates $30,000 in immediate capital—enough to fund data infrastructure buildout I'm planning (FinTech Sandbox partnerships, MacroMicro integration, proprietary dashboard development).

More than 50 doesn't help. The constraint is real.

[PAYMENT LINK]

36 hours remaining.

Best,
Bob

## FINAL DAY URGENCY EMAIL (Send Thursday Evening)

**Subject:** 12 Hours — Founding Member Window Closes Midnight Tonight

**Body:**

```
This is the last email about Founding Member tier before it closes.

Current status: 18/50 spots filled
Time remaining: 12 hours (closes midnight EST tonight)

If you've been considering this and haven't pulled the trigger yet, here's the decision framework:

Ask yourself:
• Do I consume Lighthouse Macro research regularly? (If yes, $600/year is $50/month—cheaper than most data subscriptions)
• Do I value research independence? (If yes, founding member capital funds infrastructure that prevents institutional capture)
• Will I kick myself in 3 months when institutional tier is $1,788/year and I didn't lock $600/year rate? (If yes, act now)

If answer to all three is yes, this is straightforward decision.

If answer to any is no, then professional tier ($49/month launching Monday) might be better fit.

No hard feelings either way. But if you want founding member benefits, this is the last window.

[PAYMENT LINK]

Closes midnight tonight. Won't reopen.

Best,
Bob
```

## PAYMENT & FULFILLMENT LOGISTICS

### Substack Native Payment Processing

**Advantages:**
- Integrated with your existing publication
- Automatic content gating (founding members get access, others don't)
- Simple management (view subscribers, cancel subscriptions, etc.)
- No additional fees beyond Substack's standard 10%

**Setup:**
1. Go to Substack Settings > Payments
2. Create new subscription tier: "Founding Member"
3. Set price: $600/year (annual only)
4. Add description and benefits
5. Enable tier, get payment link
6. Embed payment link in campaign emails

### Alternative: Stripe Direct Checkout

**Advantages:**
- Lower fees (2.9% + $0.30 vs. Substack's 10%)
- More control over payment flow
- Can set hard cap at 50 automatically

**Disadvantages:**
- Manual subscriber management (need to add emails to Substack manually)
- More operational overhead

**Recommendation:** Use Substack native unless fee difference is material (on $30k gross, Substack takes $3k vs. Stripe $900—so $2.1k difference if you hit 50-member cap).

For ease of execution and lower operational burden, **use Substack native payment processing**.

**Logistics:**
- Use Zoom (free account sufficient for 20 participants)
- Schedule 60-90 minutes (allow buffer for good questions)
- Record for members who can't attend live (upload to Substack member area)
- Use last 15 minutes for Q&A specific to individual positioning questions

**Scheduling:**
- Send Calendly poll to founding members for preferred time
- Pick time that works for majority (inevitably won't work for everyone)
- Schedule 4 dates for full year (December 2025, March 2026, June 2026, September 2026)
- Send calendar invites immediately so members block time

**Content Structure:**
1. **Macro regime update (20 min):** Current cycle positioning, probability distribution across growth/inflation/liquidity states
2. **Cross-asset implications (20 min):** How regime probabilities map to specific asset positioning (equities, rates, credit, FX, commodities, crypto)
3. **Tactical opportunities (10 min):** Specific trades or positioning adjustments given current regime
4. **Q&A (20 min):** Open questions from members on positioning, macro interpretation, research methodology

### Founding Member Content Access

**Substack Member-Only Posts:**
- All premium content automatically accessible to founding members
- No additional gating needed if using Substack tier system

**Early Beta Access:**
- When you build proprietary dashboards, send founding members access first (1-2 weeks before institutional tier)
- When GCI partnership or other institutional collaborations launch, founding members get announcement first

### Founding Member Recognition

**In Research Credits:**
Add footer to premium content:

```
---
Lighthouse Macro is made possible by Founding Members who fund independent research infrastructure. Thank you: [List of founding member names, if they opt in to public acknowledgment]
```

**Optional:** Create "Founding Member" section on lighthousemacro.com acknowledging early supporters (with permission).

---

## CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION TACTICS

### If Conversion Rate Low After Day 1 (<5%)

**Diagnosis:** Either list isn't engaged enough, or value proposition unclear.

**Tactic 1: Social Proof**
If you have any early conversions, email them directly asking for brief testimonial:

"Hey [Name], thanks for becoming founding member. Quick ask: Would you be comfortable with me sharing brief quote about why you joined? Helps other readers understand value. Something like: 'I joined because [specific reason].' Totally fine if not—no pressure."

Then incorporate testimonials into mid-campaign urgency email.

**Tactic 2: Founder's Story**
Share vulnerable narrative about why independence matters:

"I left [previous role/institution] specifically to build research platform without conflicts of interest. Every institutional research shop I've worked with has revenue pressure that distorts output—bullish bias when firm needs sell-side deals, bearish bias when positioning for management fees. Independence is expensive but it's non-negotiable. Founding members fund that independence."

**Tactic 3: Scarcity Acceleration**
If only 5-10 members by Wednesday, consider closing at 25-member cap instead of 50:

"Update: I'm reducing founding member cap from 50 to 25. Reason: Quarterly calls with 50 people are harder to keep intimate and high-signal. Capping at 25 ensures every member gets meaningful airtime for questions. 15 spots remaining, closes Friday midnight."

This creates perception of even more scarcity.

### If Conversion Rate High (>20%)

**Diagnosis:** Pricing is below market-clearing rate, could charge more.

**Tactic: Close Early**
If you hit 40+ members by Wednesday:

"Update: Founding Member tier is 43/50 filled as of Wednesday evening. Given pace, we'll likely hit cap before Friday deadline. If you're planning to join, act today—tier will close as soon as we hit 50 members, potentially before Friday."

Then close immediately at 50 and send "Sold Out" email:

"Founding Member tier closed this morning after reaching 50-member cap. Thank you to everyone who joined. For everyone else, Professional and Institutional tiers launch Monday with no rate lock guarantees."

### A/B Testing (If Substack Allows)

**Test Variables:**
- Subject line (urgency vs. value proposition vs. founder story)
- Price point (some newsletters test $500 vs. $600 vs. $750 to find optimal)
- Deadline (48 hours vs. 72 hours vs. 96 hours)

**Recommendation:** Don't over-optimize first campaign. Execute standard 72-hour window at $600, learn from results, optimize future campaigns based on data.

---

## SUCCESS METRICS & PROBABILITY SCENARIOS

### Conservative Scenario (5% Conversion)
- 500 subscribers x 5% = 25 founding members
- Revenue: $15,000 immediate
- **Interpretation:** Solid success, covers several months operational expenses

### Realistic Scenario (10% Conversion)
- 500 subscribers x 10% = 50 founding members (hits cap)
- Revenue: $30,000 immediate
- **Interpretation:** Strong success, funds full data infrastructure buildout

### Aggressive Scenario (>15% Conversion)
- Cap hit within 48 hours, close early
- Revenue: $30,000 immediate in 2 days
- **Interpretation:** Exceptional success, validates pricing power, consider higher pricing for institutional tier launch

### Failure Scenario (<3% Conversion)
- 500 subscribers x 3% = 15 founding members
- Revenue: $9,000 immediate
- **Interpretation:** List isn't as engaged as expected, or value proposition unclear. Adjust professional tier positioning based on feedback.

## RISK MITIGATION

**What If Payment Processing Fails?**
- Have backup Stripe checkout ready
- Test payment flow before campaign launch
- Monitor for error reports from subscribers

**What If You Don't Hit Minimum Viable Conversions?**
- Minimum viable: 10 members = $6,000 (covers a few months expenses)
- If below 10 by Thursday, extend deadline by 48 hours with "last chance" email
- If still below 10 after extension, reframe as "exclusive" small group, proceed with quarterly calls anyway

**What If You Hit Cap Too Fast?**
- Close tier immediately, send "sold out" email
- Creates FOMO for future product launches
- Validates pricing power for institutional tier

**What If Founding Members Complain About Benefits Later?**
- Set clear expectations upfront (quarterly calls, not weekly)
- Over-deliver on quality (make calls genuinely valuable)
- Add unexpected bonuses (beta dashboard access, etc.)

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR

**The 72-hour deadline must be real. No extensions except in genuine technical emergency.**

If you extend deadline casually, you train audience that deadlines are fake. Next campaign, nobody acts urgently.

Scarcity only works if you honor the constraints you set. Close at midnight Friday, no exceptions.

This is the foundation of pricing power and audience trust.
