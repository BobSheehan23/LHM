---

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Send Email (Today, within 2 hours of starting work)

**Timing Rationale:** 
- Sunday afternoon/evening = lower inbox competition
- She's already engaged with your content recently = context is fresh
- Weekend sends to institutional contacts often get Monday morning priority attention

**Where to Send:**
- LinkedIn message (primary - she reached out here)
- Email if you have it (secondary reinforcement)

**Subject Line (if email):** Macro Advisory for Digital Asset Allocators—Senda Engagement Proposal

---

### EXACT OUTREACH COPY

```
Tania,

Following up on your podcast feedback—glad you found it valuable. I'm formalizing Lighthouse Macro's institutional advisory practice and wanted to propose a structured engagement for Senda's investment process.

ADVISORY STRUCTURE

Monthly Macro Intelligence Brief (30-40 pages):

• Cross-asset regime probability assessment (growth/inflation/liquidity cycle positioning)
• Digital asset correlation dynamics (BTC/ETH/altcoin behavior relative to traditional risk assets)
• Central bank policy transmission mechanisms (Fed, ECB, BoJ policy paths and crypto capital flow implications)
• Funding market stress indicators (basis compression, perpetual funding rates, stablecoin velocity as deleveraging early warning)
• Positioning analysis (CFTC, options flow, on-chain accumulation/distribution patterns)

Quarterly Strategy Call (90 minutes):

• Portfolio construction discussion (macro regime implications for digital asset allocation)
• Tail risk scenario planning (liquidity shock preparedness, correlation breakdown events)
• Custom analysis Q&A (ad-hoc requests, specific research questions)

Ad-Hoc Chart Requests (Unlimited):

• Custom visualizations for LP updates, internal strategy documents, board presentations

PRICING

$2,500/month ($30,000 annual retainer, 15% discount if paid annually upfront)

WHY THIS STRUCTURE FITS DIGITAL ASSET ALLOCATORS

Most macro research is either too generalist (ignores crypto-specific market structure) or too crypto-native (doesn't connect traditional liquidity cycles to digital asset regime shifts). I operate at the intersection—institutional macro rigor applied directly to digital asset investment process.

Recent case study: Early October research on Treasury auction stress + crypto funding basis compression predicted deleveraging event 3 weeks before it materialized. Clients who repositioned avoided 15-20% drawdown while maintaining upside optionality.

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

If standard retainer doesn't fit Senda's budget or process:

• Quarterly engagement: $7,500/quarter (one comprehensive brief + one 90-minute call per quarter)
• Project-based: $5,000 per custom research deliverable
• Team license: $4,000/month (distributable to full investment team, includes two quarterly strategy calls)

Would this add value to Senda's investment process? Happy to discuss customization or provide sample research demonstrating the framework.

Best,
Bob Sheehan, CFA, CMT

### Step 2: Prepare Follow-Up Sequence

**If No Response Within 48 Hours (Tuesday Evening):**

```
Tania,

Circling back on the advisory proposal I sent Sunday. Wanted to flag one additional element that might be relevant for Senda's process:

I'm currently building proprietary on-chain + traditional macro correlation dashboards (integrating stablecoin flows, perpetual funding, Treasury auction stress, MOVE index volatility) specifically for digital asset allocators navigating regime uncertainty.

Early beta access available for advisory clients starting November. This provides real-time signal integration rather than retrospective analysis—useful for tactical positioning adjustments.

Happy to walk through the framework if timing works this week. Let me know what makes sense.

Best,
Bob
```

**If No Response Within 5 Days (Thursday):**

```
Tania,

Last note on this—I realize timing might not be right for structured advisory engagement, which is totally fine.

Alternative: Would you find value in a one-off custom research piece demonstrating the macro framework applied to current market conditions? 

Something like: "Q4 2025 Digital Asset Positioning: Macro Regime Probabilities and Portfolio Construction Implications" (20-25 pages, delivered within 7 days, $3,000 flat fee).

Low commitment way to evaluate whether the analytical approach fits Senda's process before exploring ongoing engagement.

Let me know if that's interesting—otherwise happy to revisit down the road.

Best,
Bob
```

### Step 3: Prepare for Call (If She Responds Positively)

**QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS TO ASK:**

1. "What's your current process for integrating macro analysis into digital asset allocation decisions?"
   - **Why:** Reveals pain points and how to position your value

2. "Who internally would consume the research? Just you, or broader investment team?"
   - **Why:** Determines if team license pricing makes sense

3. "What's your decision timeline for bringing on advisory partners? Do you need internal approvals or board sign-off?"
   - **Why:** Clarifies path to contract and cash flow timing

4. "Are there specific macro blind spots or analytical gaps you're trying to solve for?"
   - **Why:** Lets you customize deliverables to their exact needs

5. "What does your current macro research stack look like? Bloomberg, independent research shops, internal analysis?"
   - **Why:** Shows competitive landscape and where you differentiate

**PRICING FLEXIBILITY FRAMEWORK:**

| Her Budget Signal | Your Response |
|------------------|---------------|
| "$2,500/month works" | Lock at $2,500, deliver exceptional value, upsell later |
| "$2,500 is high" | Offer quarterly at $6,000 ($2,000/month effective) |
| "Need to start smaller" | One-off project at $3,000, convert to retainer after proof of value |
| "Can we do $1,500/month?" | Counter at $2,000/month with reduced deliverables (brief every 6 weeks instead of monthly) |
| "What about equity?" | Only consider if she offers 0.5-1% Senda carry allocation (not common, but some allocators do advisor carry sharing) |

**OBJECTION HANDLING:**

**Objection:** "We already get macro research from [Bank/Research Shop]"  
**Response:** "What I'm hearing from most allocators is that traditional sell-side macro doesn't connect policy transmission to digital asset market structure—it's either pure macro with no crypto application, or pure crypto analysis ignoring liquidity cycles. The synthesis is the value. Happy to do a sample brief so you can compare directly to what you're currently getting."

**Objection:** "Can we try this for one month before committing?"  
**Response:** "Totally understand wanting proof of concept. Here's what I'd suggest: I deliver one full brief + one 60-minute call for $2,500. If it's valuable, we formalize monthly retainer. If it's not, no obligation. That way you get full experience before committing to ongoing engagement."

**Objection:** "Our budget cycle doesn't reset until Q1 2026"  
**Response:** "No problem—we can structure contract start for January 1, 2026. I can send sample research in the meantime so you can evaluate fit before budget kicks in. Would that work?"

### Step 4: Contract Execution (Once She Verbally Commits)

**Use Bonsai or PandaDoc Free Tier:**

1. Create simple consulting agreement template:
   - Services: Monthly brief + quarterly call + ad-hoc charts
   - Term: Month-to-month with 30-day termination notice
   - Payment: Due on 1st of month for that month's services (NET-10 terms)
   - IP: You retain ownership, she gets non-exclusive license for internal use

2. Send via DocuSign or PandaDoc e-signature

3. Invoice immediately upon signature via Mercury or Wave

4. Deliver first brief within 7 days of contract signature (proof of value early)

---

### Step 5: First Deliverable Strategy (Maximize Retention)

**Brief Structure for First Month:**

1. **Executive Summary (1 page):** Bottom-line up front, actionable positioning recommendations
2. **Macro Regime Assessment (8-10 pages):** Growth/inflation/liquidity cycle analysis
3. **Digital Asset Correlation Analysis (8-10 pages):** BTC/ETH/alts vs traditional risk assets
4. **Funding Market Stress Indicators (5-7 pages):** Basis, perpetual funding, stablecoin flows
5. **Positioning & Flow Analysis (5-7 pages):** CFTC, options, on-chain signals
6. **Tail Risk Scenarios (3-5 pages):** What could break correlation assumptions
7. **Portfolio Implications (2-3 pages):** Specific allocation recommendations given regime probabilities

**Quality Signals to Embed:**

- Custom charts (not generic Bloomberg screenshots)
- Proprietary indicators (your own calculations, not just Bloomberg data)
- Forward-looking probabilities (not just describing what happened)
- Specific position recommendations (not vague "be cautious" language)
- Code snippets showing methodology (demonstrates reproducibility)

**Goal:** Make her think "This is significantly better than [current provider]" within first 48 hours of receiving it.

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Day 0 (Today):** Outreach sent  
**Day 2 (Tuesday):** First follow-up if no response  
**Day 5 (Friday):** Second follow-up if no response  
**Day 7 (Next Sunday):** If still no response, deprioritize and move to other consulting leads  

**Target Close:** Within 14 days of initial outreach  
**Target First Payment:** Within 21 days of initial outreach  

---

## PROBABILITY SCENARIOS

**60% Probability:** She engages, negotiates on price, closes at $1,500-2,000/month (lower than target but still meaningful revenue)

**25% Probability:** She's interested but needs to run through internal approval process, extends timeline to 30-45 days

**10% Probability:** She closes at full $2,500/month within 7 days (dream scenario)

**5% Probability:** She doesn't respond or declines (in which case, low opportunity cost—you spent 30 minutes on outreach)

---

## NEXT ACTIONS AFTER TANIA OUTREACH SENT

1. Wait 2 hours, then send Protocol Treasury outreach (parallel execution)
2. Draft Tash/GCI email (send Monday morning for best timing)
3. Build Substack founding member campaign (launch Tuesday)

Don't wait for Tania's response before executing other outreach—parallel conversion funnels maximize probability that at least one closes quickly.
