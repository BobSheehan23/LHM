# LIGHTHOUSE MACRO: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Founder & CIO:** Bob Sheehan, CFA, CMT

## WHO WE ARE

**Lighthouse Macro** delivers institutional-grade macro intelligence across all domains—labor, credit, plumbing, markets—synthesized into actionable frameworks. Our competitive advantage is not expertise in any single domain, but **institutional-grade depth across ALL macro domains combined with cross-domain synthesis capability**.

### The Differentiation

**What makes us different:**
- **Full-Spectrum Depth:** Equivalent expertise to domain specialists across ALL fields (labor, credit, Fed plumbing, market structure)
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis:** Connect labor flows → credit spreads → equity valuations → Fed plumbing in unified transmission chains
- **Proprietary Indicators:** Quantified frameworks (MRI, LFI, LCI) with backtested performance
- **Independent Perspective:** No sell-side conflicts; contrarian positioning when data supports it

**What we refuse to be:**
- "The labor guy" or "the plumbing guy" (specialists with limited range)
- Shallow generalists (surface-level coverage)
- Consensus-oriented research (we follow signal, not narrative)

---

## CORE CAPABILITIES

### 1. Three-Pillar Analytical Framework

**Every position passes through integrated analysis:**

**Pillar 1: Macro Dynamics (The Cycle)**
- Labor flows → Income → Spending → Profits transmission chain
- Leading indicators: Quits rate, openings, long-term unemployment
- **Key insight:** Flows precede stocks (quits leads unemployment by 6-9 months)

**Pillar 2: Monetary Mechanics (The Plumbing)**
- Fed balance sheet → reserves → dealer capacity → funding stress
- Leading indicators: RRP/GDP, reserves/GDP, SOFR-EFFR spread
- **Key insight:** RRP exhaustion removes system's shock absorber

**Pillar 3: Market Technicals (The Expression)**
- Positioning, volatility, cross-asset correlations
- Leading indicators: VIX term structure, equity-bond correlation, breadth
- **Key insight:** Crowded trades unwind violently in regime shifts

### 2. Proprietary Indicators

**Macro Risk Index (MRI)** - Master composite synthesizing labor, liquidity, and credit stress
- MRI > 1.0 historically precedes recession with 100% precision (no false positives)
- Average 9-month lead time to recession start
- Currently elevated: Defensive positioning appropriate

**Labor Fragility Index (LFI)** - Early warning of labor market deterioration
- Composite of quits rate, long-term unemployment, hires/quits ratio
- Correlation with forward unemployment: +0.65
- Lead time vs unemployment: 6-9 months

**Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)** - System's ability to absorb shocks
- Average of RRP/GDP and Reserves/GDP (z-scored)
- Correlation with VIX: -0.52
- Currently thin: Limited buffer for shocks

### 3. Domain Expertise (Institutional Depth)

**We maintain publication-quality expertise across:**
- Labor Markets & Employment Flows
- Credit Architecture & Corporate Debt
- Treasury Markets & Government Debt
- Monetary Plumbing & Fed Operations
- Market Microstructure & Dealer Capacity
- Cryptocurrency & Digital Asset Integration
- Fiscal Policy & Government Finance
- Securities Lending & Positioning
- Housing Markets & Residential Investment
- Commodities & Precious Metals
- International Trade & Currency Flows
- Consumer Behavior & Spending Dynamics

## INVESTMENT APPROACH

### Philosophy: Regime-Based Concentration

**High-conviction macro positioning** based on systematic identification of regime shifts. Concentrated portfolios (3-5 positions typically, up to 10 maximum) across equities, rates, credit, commodities, currencies, and digital assets.

### Position Construction

**Signal thresholds drive allocation:**
- MRI < 0.0: Overweight equities (65-70%)
- MRI 0.0-0.5: Neutral positioning (55-60% equities)
- MRI 0.5-1.0: Reduce beta (45-50% equities)
- MRI 1.0-1.5: Defensive (30-40% equities, add cash)
- MRI > 1.5: Maximum defense (20-30% equities, crisis hedges)

### Risk Management

**Dual stop-loss framework:**
1. **Thesis-based stops:** Exit when regime indicators reverse (e.g., LFI drops below 0.0)
2. **Price-based stops:** Exit when technical structure breaks (e.g., 50-day MA crosses below 200-day)

**Use whichever triggers first.** Preserve capital, reassess, re-enter when signals realign.

**Position limits:**
- Maximum single position: 30%
- Maximum gross exposure: 100% (no leverage)
- Drawdown protocols: Progressive risk reduction at -5%, -10%, -15%

## RECENT PERFORMANCE

### November 2025 Case Study

**Liquidity Transmission Framework delivered +29.43% alpha during acute market stress**

**Framework correctly identified:**
- RRP exhaustion creating funding vulnerabilities
- Dealer balance sheet constraints tightening
- Treasury auction stress emerging
- Risk asset repricing imminent

**Result:** Defensive positioning limited downside while maintaining upside participation when conditions stabilized.

### Early Warning Success (2024-25)

**Identified labor market fragility Q1 2024**, 6-9 months before consensus recognition:
- LFI crossed +0.5 as quits rate deteriorated to 2.0%
- Credit markets complacent (HY OAS at 3rd percentile)
- Reduced equity exposure 60% → 50% in October 2024

**Outcome:** Avoided late-cycle drawdowns; positioned defensively ahead of market

## CURRENT MARKET VIEW (December 2025)

### Regime Assessment: Phase 3 Stress Conditions

**Labor Dynamics:**
- Quits rate: 1.9% (below 2.0% pre-recession threshold)
- Long-term unemployment: 25.7% (above 22% fragility threshold)
- LFI: +0.93 (elevated, defensive signal)

**Monetary Mechanics:**
- RRP: ~$100B (down from $2.5T peak - buffer exhausted)
- SOFR-EFFR spread: 11 bps (widening, early funding stress)
- LCI: -0.8 (approaching scarce territory)

**Market Technicals:**
- S&P 500 valuations: 21x forward P/E (expensive)
- Credit spreads: 3rd percentile tightness (complacent)
- Cross-asset correlations: Rising (diversification breaking)

**Synthesis: MRI = +1.1 (HIGH RISK)**

### Current Positioning

**Tactical allocation:**
- Equities: 40% (underweight -20% vs 60% strategic)
- Bonds: 45% (overweight +5%)
- Cash: 10% (optionality for rebalancing)
- Defensive sectors: 3% (XLV healthcare)
- Crisis hedge: 2% (GLD gold)

**Invalidation criteria:**
- Quits rate rises above 2.1%
- Fed emergency liquidity intervention
- Credit spreads widen >500 bps (stress already priced)
