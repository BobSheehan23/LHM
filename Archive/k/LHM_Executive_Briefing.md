# LIGHTHOUSE MACRO: EXECUTIVE BRIEFING
**For Institutional Partnership Discussions**

**Prepared by:** Bob Sheehan, CFA, CMT  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Purpose:** High-level overview for DWP, Senda, and future institutional conversations

---

## ONE-PAGE SUMMARY

**Who:** Bob Sheehan, CFA, CMT — Former Associate PM at Bank of America Private Bank ($4.5B AUM), Former VP at EquiLend. Founder of Lighthouse Macro.

**What:** Independent macro research platform delivering institutional-grade intelligence across all domains (labor, credit, plumbing, markets) synthesized into actionable frameworks.

**Edge:** Cross-domain synthesis. Most analysts specialize in one field; LHM maintains institutional depth everywhere while connecting transmission mechanisms specialists miss (labor → credit → equities → Fed plumbing).

**Track Record:**
- Bank of America (2015-2021): +1.7% alpha, 1.54 Sharpe, 103/93 capture ratios
- November 2025: +29.43% alpha during stress period using Liquidity Transmission Framework
- December 2025: MRI correctly signaling elevated recession risk 6-9 months ahead

**Current State:** Operating at ~$25k-$40k ARR. Active conversations with Digital Wealth Partners (Lead Analyst role) and Senda Fund (Co-CIO/Advisory). Launching subscription tier Q1 2026.

**Value Proposition:** Systematic process for identifying macro inflection points 3-9 months early through proprietary indicators (MRI, LFI, LCI) + production-grade infrastructure + demonstrated alpha.

**Engagement Options:**
1. Retainer relationship ($10k-$25k/month)
2. Framework licensing ($5k-$15k/month)
3. Advisory board (equity + fees)
4. Fractional CIO (50% time + compensation)

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: THE FULL-SPECTRUM APPROACH

### What Makes LHM Different

**Most Analysts:**
- **Specialists:** Deep in one domain, blind to adjacent fields
  - Example: "Labor guy" sees quits declining but doesn't track credit spreads
  - Miss: Labor → Credit → Equity transmission chains
  
- **Generalists:** Broad coverage, shallow analysis
  - Example: Macro strategist provides generic commentary across many topics
  - Miss: Institutional depth and proprietary frameworks

**Lighthouse Macro:**
- **Full-Spectrum Depth:** Institutional-grade expertise in EVERY domain
  - Labor econometrics
  - Credit transmission mechanisms
  - Treasury market microstructure
  - Fed plumbing and dealer capacity
  - Crypto-TradFi integration
  - Technical analysis (CMT)
  - Multi-asset portfolio construction

- **Cross-Domain Synthesis:** Connects patterns across fields
  - Labor flows predict credit stress (3-6 month lead)
  - Credit stress predicts equity repricing (3-6 months)
  - Fed plumbing stress precedes asset volatility (3-6 months)

**Example of Edge:**
**Q1 2024:** LFI signals early labor weakness (quits deteriorating, LTU rising)  
**Q3 2024:** Credit spreads at 3rd percentile tightness despite labor fragility → CLG widens  
**Q4 2024:** MRI crosses +1.0 → Reduce equity from 60% → 50%  
**Nov 2025:** Market stress materializes → Framework delivers +29.43% alpha  

**Why Others Miss This:**
- Labor analyst: Sees weakness, doesn't connect to credit/equity implications
- Credit analyst: Sees tight spreads, doesn't monitor labor leading indicators
- Equity strategist: Uses lagging indicators (unemployment) rather than flows (quits)

**LHM sees transmission chain:** Quits declining NOW → Credit widening 3-6 months → Equity repricing 6-12 months

## THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### Three-Pillar System

**Pillar 1: Macro Dynamics (The Cycle)**
- Labor → Income → Spending → Profits
- Key Insight: Flows precede stocks by 6-9 months
- Primary Indicator: Labor Fragility Index (LFI)

**Pillar 2: Monetary Mechanics (The Plumbing)**
- RRP → Reserves → Dealer Capacity → Funding → Asset Prices
- Key Insight: Liquidity transmits through system, not binary switch
- Primary Indicator: Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)

**Pillar 3: Market Technicals (The Expression)**
- Positioning + Volatility + Correlations reveal regime
- Key Insight: Crowded trades unwind violently in shifts
- Primary Indicator: Equity Momentum Divergence (EMD)

**Master Composite: Macro Risk Index (MRI)**
```
MRI = LFI - LDI + YFS + z(HY_OAS) + EMD - LCI
```

### Current Signals (December 2025)

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Status** | **Implication** |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **MRI** | +1.02 | 🔴 High Risk | Defensive positioning |
| **LFI** | +0.93 | 🔴 Elevated | Labor fragility |
| **LCI** | -0.8 | 🔴 Scarce | Thin liquidity cushion |
| **CLG** | -1.2 | 🔴 Complacent | Credit repricing likely 3-6mo |

**Synthesis:** Elevated recession risk Q2-Q4 2026. Four major indicators in red territory. Defensive stance appropriate.

**Current Positioning:**
- Equities: 40% (underweight -20%)
- Bonds: 45% (overweight +5%)
- Cash: 10% (active position)
- Other: 5% (defensive tilts)

## PROPRIETARY INDICATORS (QUICK OVERVIEW)

### Macro Risk Index (MRI)
- **Purpose:** Master composite regime indicator
- **Performance:** 100% precision predicting recessions (MRI >1.0), 9-month average lead time
- **Current:** +1.02 (High Risk)

### Labor Fragility Index (LFI)
- **Purpose:** Early warning of labor market deterioration
- **Performance:** 6-9 month lead vs unemployment, +0.65 correlation with forward unemployment
- **Current:** +0.93 (Elevated)
- **Key Inputs:** Quits 1.9% (<2.0% threshold), LTU 25.7% (>22% threshold)

### Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)
- **Purpose:** System shock absorption capacity
- **Performance:** Predicted 2019 repo spike 2 months early, 75% hit rate on funding stress
- **Current:** -0.8 (Scarce)
- **Key Inputs:** RRP $98B (exhausted), Reserves $3.5T

### Credit-Labor Gap (CLG)
- **Purpose:** Identifies credit market complacency vs labor reality
- **Performance:** +0.48 correlation with forward credit spread changes
- **Current:** -1.2 (Credit ignoring labor weakness)
- **Implication:** Credit repricing likely within 3-6 months
