# LIGHTHOUSE MACRO: QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
**Executive Summaries & Navigation**

**Last Updated:** December 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Quick navigation and high-level summaries of all LHM frameworks

---

## CURRENT STATE SNAPSHOT (December 2025)

**Market Signals:**
- **MRI:** +1.02 (High Risk territory)
- **LFI:** +0.93 (Labor fragility elevated)
- **LCI:** -0.8 (Liquidity cushion scarce)
- **CLG:** -1.2 (Credit markets complacent vs labor reality)

**Positioning:**
- Equities: 40% (underweight -20% vs 60% strategic)
- Bonds: 45% (overweight +5% vs 40% strategic)
- Cash: 10% (active position for optionality)
- Other: 5% (defensive tilts: XLV, GLD)

**Thesis:**
Elevated recession risk Q2-Q4 2026. Labor deterioration (quits 1.9%, LTU 25.7%) predicts credit stress + equity repricing within 3-9 months. RRP exhaustion removes system shock absorber. Defensive positioning appropriate.

**Invalidation Criteria:**
- Quits rate rises >2.1%
- Job openings rise >8.5M
- Fed emergency QE intervention
- MRI drops <0.5 sustained

**Business Status:**
- Active institutional conversations: DWP, Senda Fund
- Revenue run-rate: $25k-$40k ARR
- Q1 2026 launch: Founding Member subscriptions
- EOY 2026 target: $245k-$490k ARR

## THE THREE-PILLAR FRAMEWORK (QUICK VERSION)

### Pillar 1: Macro Dynamics (The Cycle)
**Labor → Income → Spending → Profits**

Key insight: Flows precede stocks by 6-9 months
- Quits rate → leading indicator of labor weakness
- Job openings/unemployed → labor tightness
- Long-term unemployment → structural damage

Primary indicator: **Labor Fragility Index (LFI)**

### Pillar 2: Monetary Mechanics (The Plumbing)
**RRP → Reserves → Dealers → Funding → Asset Prices**

Key insight: Liquidity transmits through system, not binary switch
- RRP exhaustion removes shock absorber
- Reserve scarcity constrains dealer capacity
- Funding stress precedes asset repricing

Primary indicator: **Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)**

### Pillar 3: Market Technicals (The Expression)
**Positioning + Volatility + Correlations**

Key insight: Crowded trades unwind violently in regime shifts
- Elevated positioning = vulnerability
- Low volatility = complacency
- Correlation spikes = diversification breaks

Primary indicator: **Equity Momentum Divergence (EMD)**

### Master Composite: MRI

```
MRI = LFI - LDI + YFS + z(HY_OAS) + EMD - LCI
```

**Interpretation:**
- MRI < 0.0: Low risk → overweight equities
- MRI 0.0-0.5: Neutral → strategic allocation (60/40)
- MRI 0.5-1.0: Elevated → reduce beta, add quality
- MRI 1.0-1.5: High risk → defensive stance
- MRI > 1.5: Extreme → maximum defense (recession likely)

## PROPRIETARY INDICATORS (CHEAT SHEET)

**Labor Fragility Index (LFI)**
- **What:** Composite of labor leading indicators
- **Components:** LTU %, quits rate, hires/quits, temp help
- **Threshold:** >+0.8 = elevated recession risk
- **Current:** +0.93 🔴
- **Performance:** 100% precision, 6-9 month lead time

**Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)**
- **What:** System shock absorption capacity
- **Components:** RRP/GDP + Reserves/GDP (z-scored)
- **Threshold:** <-0.5 = funding stress likely
- **Current:** -0.8 🔴
- **Performance:** Predicted 2019 repo spike 2 months early

**Credit-Labor Gap (CLG)**
- **What:** Credit market complacency vs labor reality
- **Formula:** z(HY_OAS) - z(LFI)
- **Threshold:** |Gap| >1.0 = repricing likely 3-6 months
- **Current:** -1.2 🔴
- **Interpretation:** Credit ignoring labor weakness

**Yield-Funding Stress (YFS)**
- **What:** Curve inversion + repo stress composite
- **Components:** 2s10s spread, SOFR-EFFR, term premium
- **Threshold:** >+1.0 = elevated funding stress
- **Current:** +0.6 🟢

**Labor Dynamism Index (LDI)**
- **What:** Worker confidence and job churn
- **Components:** Quits, job-to-job transitions, voluntary departures
- **Usage:** Positive signal (higher = more confidence)
- **Note:** LDI declining = workers cautious

### Portfolio Structure by MRI Regime

| **MRI** | **Regime** | **Equity** | **Bond** | **Cash** | **Other** |
|---------|------------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| <0.0 | Goldilocks | 65-70% | 25-30% | 0-5% | 0-5% |
| 0.0-0.5 | Neutral | 55-60% | 35-40% | 0-5% | 0-5% |

### Risk Management Rules

**Position Limits:**
- Max single position: 30%
- Max sector concentration: 40%
- Max gross exposure: 100% (no leverage)
- Min liquidity: 5%

**Dual Stop-Loss System:**

## TRANSMISSION MECHANISM TIMELINES

### Labor → Credit → Equities

**Month 0-3:** Labor signals deteriorate
- Quits rate declines
- Long-term unemployment rises
- Temp help employment falls

**Month 3-6:** Credit markets begin repricing
- HY spreads widen from tight levels
- Investment grade spreads follow
- Loan officer standards tighten

**Month 6-12:** Equity repricing accelerates
- Earnings expectations reset
- Multiples compress
- Breadth deteriorates

**Month 12-18:** Unemployment rises (lagging)
- Layoffs materialize
- Consumer spending weakens
- Recession manifests

**Key Insight:** By time unemployment rises, equity repricing is ~80% complete. Flows precede stocks.

### Plumbing → Asset Prices

**Phase 1:** RRP drains (already happened)
- From $2.5T → $100B over 2 years
- Treasury issuance absorbed without reserve drain
- **Status:** Complete

**Phase 2:** Reserve scarcity emerges (current)
- Bill issuance now drains reserves directly
- Dealer balance sheets constrained
- **Status:** In progress

**Phase 3:** Funding stress materializes (3-6 months)
- SOFR-EFFR spread widens >15 bps sustained
- Repo fails increase
- SRF facility usage rises
- **Status:** Watch for

**Phase 4:** Asset repricing (6-12 months)
- Treasury auctions show tails
- Term premium rises
- Risk assets reprice (discount rate + liquidity drain)
- **Status:** Setup developing

## BUSINESS STRATEGY (QUICK VERSION)

### Revenue Tiers

**Tier 1: Institutional ($500k-$750k target)**
- Retainers: $5k-$25k/month
- Custom research: $10k-$50k/project
- Advisory board: Equity + fees

**Tier 2: Subscription ($200k-$300k target)**
- Founding Member: $500/year
- Professional: $2,500/year

**Tier 3: Data/Education ($50k-$150k target)**
- Data licensing, expert networks, courses

### Active Conversations (Dec 2025)

**Digital Wealth Partners:**
- Stage: Active discussion
- Role: Lead Analyst
- Structure: Exploring fractional/retainer + equity
- Next: Follow-up call Jan 2026 post-Horizon

**Senda Fund (Tania Reid):**
- Stage: Early exploration
- Role: Co-CIO / Advisory
- Structure: TBD (multiple options)
- Next: Concrete structure discussion Q1 2026

**Global Capital Institute:**
- Stage: Closed
- Reason: Predatory IP terms (100% assignment, 3-year non-compete, zero guarantee)
- Learning: Walk away from bad deals, negotiate from strength

### Strategic Approach: Hybrid Model

**Recommendation:** Fractional/advisory arrangements with 1-2 institutional anchors PLUS independent subscription growth

**Why:**
- ✓ Accelerated revenue ($200k-$300k Y1)
- ✓ Maintains LHM independence + IP ownership
- ✓ Institutional validation + case studies
- ✓ Preserves optionality for future growth
- ✓ Diversified revenue (not single-institution dependent)

### 5-Year Trajectory

- **2026:** $200k-$350k ARR (foundation)
- **2027:** $500k-$750k ARR (traction)
- **2028:** $800k-$1.2M ARR (maturity)
- **2029:** $1M+ ARR sustained → optionality moment
- **2030:** Scale/partner/exit decision from position of strength

## KEY CONCEPTS GLOSSARY

**Anti-Specialization:** Maintaining institutional depth across ALL domains, not just one

**Cross-Domain Synthesis:** Connecting labor → credit → equities patterns specialists miss

**Falsifiable Frameworks:** Theses with explicit invalidation criteria (testable, not narrative)

**Flow vs Stock:** Rates of change (flows) lead levels (stocks) as indicators

**Liquidity Transmission:** How Fed balance sheet changes flow through reserves → dealers → assets

**Regime-Based:** Positioning driven by quantified indicators, not market narratives

**The Buffer:** System shock absorption (RRP + reserves) preventing small bumps → big damage

**The Last Mile:** Structural 3% inflation regime (not transitory bump deflating to 2%)

**The Plumbing:** Fed balance sheet mechanics, dealer capacity, repo markets, funding stress

**60/40/0 Rule:** 60% institutional rigor / 40% authentic voice / 0% corporate fluff
