# Global Macro Outlook 2024-2025

## Executive Summary

As we approach 2025, the global economic landscape presents an intricate web of challenges and opportunities that defies simple characterization. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a world of increasing complexity, where traditional economic relationships are being tested by unprecedented policy experiments, shifting political dynamics, and persistent inflationary pressures. This report synthesizes multiple data sources and expert analyses to provide a thorough examination of current conditions and future trajectories, with particular attention to the emerging phenomenon of divergent economic experiences across different segments of society and the stubborn nature of inflation despite aggressive policy responses.

## The Global Economic Landscape

The current economic environment is characterized by remarkable regional disparities and persistent inflationary pressures. While the United States demonstrates unexpected resilience, with Q4 GDP estimates moderating from 3% to 1.8% according to the NY Fed Nowcast, the economy continues to grapple with inflation that has proven more durable than initially anticipated. This economic resilience masks an increasingly pronounced divergence in economic experiences across different segments of society, a phenomenon we've termed the "80/20 recession."

The persistence of inflation, particularly in the services sector, has become a central concern for policymakers and market participants alike. Despite earlier expectations of transitory price pressures, services inflation remains elevated, driven by sticky wage growth and robust labor market conditions. This has created a complex environment where traditional policy tools face new challenges in achieving price stability without triggering significant economic disruption.

## Inflation Dynamics and Policy Challenges

The inflation narrative has evolved significantly from earlier expectations of transitory price pressures. Current data shows U.S. inflation running almost exactly as anticipated, with services inflation remaining particularly stubborn. This persistence can be attributed to several key factors: a resilient labor market maintaining upward pressure on wages, supply chain adjustments that have created durable inflationary pressures rather than temporary disruptions, and the unanchoring of inflation expectations among consumers and market participants.

The Federal Reserve faces a delicate balancing act. The need to establish credibility in bringing inflation back to target suggests continued hawkish policy measures may be necessary, potentially requiring higher rates than markets currently anticipate. However, this aggressive stance must be weighed against the risk of triggering a recession, with the path to a "soft landing" becoming increasingly narrow.

## Labor Market Dynamics

The employment landscape presents a fascinating study in contrasts, particularly in its relationship to inflation. While headline unemployment figures remain historically low, the labor market's strength has become a double-edged sword. Strong wage growth, while beneficial for workers, has contributed to persistent services inflation. Recent months have witnessed a notable shift in employment patterns, with full-time employment declining while part-time work expands, yet overall labor market tightness continues to fuel wage pressures.

The sharp decline in Indeed job postings since September 2020, coupled with a near-doubling of long-term unemployment year-over-year, suggests a gradual but persistent softening in labor market conditions. However, job openings remain above historical averages, maintaining upward pressure on wages and, by extension, services inflation.

## Monetary Policy Landscape

The monetary policy environment has become increasingly complex as central banks navigate persistent inflation pressures. The Federal Reserve's path forward appears more challenging than previously anticipated, with markets potentially underestimating the extent of policy tightening needed to bring inflation sustainably back to target. The acceptance of above-target inflation may become necessary to avoid severe economic disruption, though this carries its own risks of further unanchoring inflation expectations.

The European Central Bank faces similar challenges, though with different regional dynamics at play. The Bank of Japan's normalization path takes on added significance in this context, as global monetary policy divergence creates both opportunities and challenges for investors, particularly in currency markets.

## Investment Implications

The current market environment, characterized by persistent inflation and potential policy surprises, demands a particularly nuanced approach to investment strategy. The possibility of higher-for-longer interest rates has significant implications for asset allocation decisions. European equity valuations present compelling opportunities, particularly given extreme discounts to U.S. markets, but investors must carefully weigh these opportunities against potential risks from trade policy shifts and political uncertainty.

Real estate investments require careful market selection, with focus on areas demonstrating sustainable economic diversity and favorable demographic trends. The persistent nature of inflation suggests maintaining exposure to real assets and inflation-protected securities may be prudent, while the potential for continued monetary tightening suggests caution in duration positioning.

## Conclusion

As we move into 2025, the global economic landscape presents a complex set of challenges centered around persistent inflation, divergent monetary policies, and elevated political uncertainty. The unusual nature of the current "80/20 recession," combined with sticky inflation in key sectors, creates an environment that requires careful navigation. Success will depend on the ability to identify and capitalize on specific opportunities while maintaining awareness of the broader risk environment, particularly the challenges posed by persistent inflation and potentially more aggressive monetary policy responses.

The path forward requires careful consideration of both macro trends and specific market opportunities, while maintaining awareness of the significant political and policy risks that could impact market dynamics. As we progress through this period of transition, the ability to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining a long-term perspective will be crucial for investment success.
