# PILLAR 8: GOVERNMENT

## The Fiscal Transmission Chain

Government isn't just policy—it's **$6.5 trillion in annual spending** and **$35 trillion in outstanding debt**. The transmission mechanism operates through cascading fiscal impulses and crowding effects:

```
Fiscal Policy → Deficit Spending → Treasury Issuance →
Interest Rates → Private Investment Crowding →
Growth Impact → Tax Receipts →
Deficit (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** We've entered **Fiscal Dominance**—the regime where fiscal policy overwhelms monetary policy. The Fed can hike all it wants, but if Treasury is issuing $2T+ annually, the supply of duration crushes bond prices regardless. The term premium is the honest signal. It must reprice.

The beauty of fiscal data: it's **knowable in advance**. Unlike earnings or inflation, we know the deficit trajectory. We know the debt ceiling. We know the maturity schedule. The only uncertainty is whether markets price it correctly. They rarely do.

## Why Government Matters: The Fiscal Gorilla

Federal spending is **23% of GDP**. Federal debt is **120% of GDP**. Interest expense is the **fastest-growing budget item**. Government has become the marginal price-setter in fixed income markets.

**The Cascade:**

**1. Government → Growth:** Fiscal impulse directly adds/subtracts from GDP (coincident)
**2. Government → Rates:** Treasury supply determines long-end yields (3-6 month lag)
**3. Government → Inflation:** Deficit spending is demand stimulus (6-12 month lag)
**4. Government → Credit:** Treasury yields set the risk-free floor for all credit (immediate)
**5. Government → Private Investment:** Crowding out when deficits absorb savings (1-2 year lag)

Get the fiscal call right, and you've triangulated the bond market. Miss it, and you're fighting the largest borrower on Earth.

**Current State:** Fiscal policy is **structurally expansionary** despite elevated rates. FY2025 deficit tracking **$1.9T** (7.2% of GDP). Interest expense at **$1.1T** (16% of spending, larger than defense). Debt/GDP at **122%**. We're running wartime deficits in peacetime. The bond market vigilantes are waking up—term premium rising from -50 bps to +25 bps. More repricing ahead.

## Primary Indicators: The Complete Architecture

### A. DEFICIT & SPENDING (The Flow)

The deficit is the **annual flow** that adds to the debt stock. It determines Treasury issuance requirements and the fiscal impulse to GDP.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Federal Budget Deficit (Monthly)** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Monthly surplus/deficit |
| **Federal Budget Deficit (12M Rolling)** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Trailing 12-month deficit |
| **Federal Budget Deficit (% GDP)** | CBO/Treasury | Quarterly | Coincident | Normalized to economy size |
| **Federal Outlays** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Total spending |
| **Federal Receipts** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Total revenue |
| **CBO Deficit Projection** | CBO | Biannual | **Leading 1-10 yrs** | Official baseline forecast |
| **Primary Deficit** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Deficit ex-interest (structural) |

#### Derived Deficit Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deficit/GDP** | 12M Deficit / GDP | >5% | Unsustainable (non-recession) |
| **Primary Deficit/GDP** | (Deficit - Interest) / GDP | >3% | Structural imbalance |
| **Receipts YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <0% | Revenue shortfall |
| **Outlays YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | >8% | Spending surge |
| **Deficit Momentum** | Current 12M - Prior 12M | >$200B | Widening |

#### Regime Thresholds: Deficit

| **Indicator** | **Crisis** | **Elevated** | **Normal** | **Surplus** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Deficit/GDP** | >8% | 5-8% | 2-5% | <2% or surplus |
| **Primary Deficit/GDP** | >5% | 3-5% | 0-3% | Surplus |
| **Outlays/GDP** | >25% | 22-25% | 19-22% | <19% |
| **Receipts/GDP** | <16% | 16-17% | 17-19% | >19% |

**The Structural Deficit:** FY2025 deficit tracking **$1.9T** (7.2% of GDP)—**wartime levels in peacetime**. Primary deficit (ex-interest) at **$800B** (3.0% of GDP)—still elevated. Outlays at 23.5% of GDP. Receipts at 16.3% of GDP. The math doesn't balance. It hasn't for 20 years. But the bill is coming due.

### B. DEBT STOCK & DYNAMICS (The Accumulation)

The debt stock is the **accumulated deficits** that must be serviced. Debt/GDP trajectory determines long-term sustainability.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Federal Debt: Total Public** | GFDEBTN | Quarterly | Lagging | Total outstanding debt |
| **Federal Debt Held by Public** | FYGFDPUN | Quarterly | Lagging | Debt ex-intragovernmental |
| **Debt Held by Public (% GDP)** | Derived | Quarterly | Lagging | Key sustainability metric |
| **Debt Held by Federal Reserve** | FDHBFRBN | Weekly | Coincident | QE/QT impact |
| **Debt Held by Foreign Investors** | TIC Data | Monthly | Lagging | Foreign demand |
| **Marketable Debt Outstanding** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Bills + Notes + Bonds + TIPS |
| **Weighted Average Maturity** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Duration of debt stock |

#### Derived Debt Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Debt/GDP** | Public Debt / GDP | >100% | Elevated |
| **Debt Growth YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | >8% | Unsustainable accumulation |
| **Foreign Holdings %** | Foreign / Total Public | <25% | Domestic absorption stress |
| **Fed Holdings %** | Fed / Total Public | <15% | QT impact |
| **WAM (Years)** | Weighted Average Maturity | <5 yrs | Rollover risk |

#### Regime Thresholds: Debt

| **Indicator** | **Crisis** | **Elevated** | **Normal** | **Low** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Debt/GDP (Public)** | >130% | 100-130% | 60-100% | <60% |
| **Debt Growth YoY%** | >12% | 8-12% | 3-8% | <3% |
| **Foreign Holdings %** | <20% | 20-28% | 28-35% | >35% |
| **WAM** | <4.5 yrs | 4.5-5.5 yrs | 5.5-6.5 yrs | >6.5 yrs |

**The Debt Wall:** Debt held by public at **$28.2T** (122% of GDP)—highest since WWII. Debt growth at +9.5% YoY. Foreign holdings at **24%** (down from 34% in 2015)—foreigners buying less, domestic buyers must absorb more. WAM at **5.8 years**—not crisis level, but $8.5T matures in next 12 months requiring refinancing at higher rates.

---

### C. INTEREST EXPENSE (The Compounding Problem)

Interest expense is the **fastest-growing spending category**. As rates stay elevated and debt grows, interest crowds out discretionary spending.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Net Interest Outlays** | Treasury/CBO | Monthly | Coincident | Interest payments |
| **Interest/Total Outlays** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Share of spending |
| **Interest/Receipts** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Revenue absorption |
| **Interest/GDP** | Derived | Quarterly | Coincident | Economic burden |
| **Weighted Average Interest Rate** | Treasury | Monthly | Lagging | Blended cost of debt |
| **Marginal Cost of Debt (10Y)** | FRED | Daily | Coincident | Cost of new issuance |

#### Derived Interest Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Interest/Outlays** | Interest / Total Spending | >15% | Crowding out discretionary |
| **Interest/Receipts** | Interest / Revenue | >20% | Revenue stress |
| **Interest/GDP** | Interest / GDP | >4% | Elevated burden |
| **Rate Sensitivity** | Debt × Rate Change | Per 100 bps | Impact of rate moves |
| **Blended Rate Gap** | 10Y Yield - WAI | >+150 bps | Rollover cost increase |

#### Regime Thresholds: Interest

| **Indicator** | **Crisis** | **Elevated** | **Normal** | **Low** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Interest/Outlays** | >20% | 15-20% | 10-15% | <10% |
| **Interest/Receipts** | >25% | 18-25% | 12-18% | <12% |
| **Interest/GDP** | >5% | 3.5-5% | 2-3.5% | <2% |
| **Weighted Avg Interest Rate** | >4% | 3-4% | 2-3% | <2% |

**The Interest Explosion:** Net interest at **$1.1T** (FY2025 tracking)—**larger than defense spending** for first time ever. Interest/outlays at **16%** (up from 8% in 2021). Interest/receipts at **20%**. Weighted average interest rate at **3.3%**, but 10Y at 4.6%—every dollar of rollover costs more. At current trajectory, interest hits **$1.5T by 2027** (CBO baseline). This is the compounding trap.

---

### D. TREASURY ISSUANCE & AUCTIONS (The Supply Pressure)

Treasury issuance is the **supply side** of the bond market. When issuance exceeds demand, prices fall (yields rise). Auction metrics reveal stress.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Quarterly Refunding Announcement** | Treasury | Quarterly | **Leading 3 mo** | Issuance guidance |
| **Net Marketable Borrowing** | Treasury | Quarterly | Coincident | Actual supply |
| **Auction Bid-to-Cover Ratio** | Treasury | Per auction | Coincident | Demand strength |
| **Auction Tail (Yield vs When-Issued)** | Treasury | Per auction | Coincident | Weak demand signal |
| **Primary Dealer Take-Down %** | NY Fed | Per auction | Coincident | Dealer absorption |
| **Indirect Bidder %** | Treasury | Per auction | Coincident | Foreign demand proxy |
| **Direct Bidder %** | Treasury | Per auction | Coincident | Domestic non-dealer |
| **Bills Outstanding** | Treasury | Weekly | Coincident | Short-term funding |
| **Coupons Outstanding** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Duration supply |

#### Derived Issuance Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quarterly Issuance** | Net Borrowing | >$600B | Heavy supply |
| **Bills as % of Marketable** | Bills / Total | >22% | Short-term funding stress |
| **Auction Tail (bps)** | Stop Yield - When-Issued | >2 bps | Weak demand |
| **Bid-to-Cover Trend** | Current - 12M Avg | <-0.3 | Demand deterioration |
| **Primary Dealer Share** | Dealer % - Historical Avg | >+10 ppts | Forced absorption |

#### Regime Thresholds: Issuance

| **Indicator** | **Stress** | **Elevated** | **Normal** | **Easy** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Quarterly Net Borrowing** | >$700B | $500-700B | $300-500B | <$300B |
| **Bills % of Marketable** | >25% | 20-25% | 15-20% | <15% |
| **Avg Auction Tail (10Y)** | >3 bps | 1-3 bps | 0-1 bps | Negative |
| **Bid-to-Cover (10Y)** | <2.3 | 2.3-2.5 | 2.5-2.7 | >2.7 |

**The Issuance Tsunami:** Q1 2026 net borrowing estimate: **$680B**. FY2026 total: **$2.1T**. Bills at 21% of marketable debt (down from 24% peak, Treasury extending duration). Recent 10Y auctions tailing by **2-3 bps** consistently—weak demand. Primary dealer take-down elevated at **18%** (vs 12% historical)—dealers forced to absorb. The market is struggling to digest supply.

---

### E. FISCAL IMPULSE (The GDP Impact)

The fiscal impulse measures how much fiscal policy **adds or subtracts** from GDP growth. Positive impulse = expansionary. Negative = contractionary.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fiscal Impulse (Brookings/Hutchins)** | Brookings | Quarterly | Coincident | GDP contribution estimate |
| **Cyclically-Adjusted Deficit** | CBO | Annual | Lagging | Structural vs cyclical |
| **Government Contribution to GDP** | BEA | Quarterly | Lagging | Direct GDP impact |
| **State & Local Surplus/Deficit** | Census | Quarterly | Lagging | Non-federal fiscal stance |
| **Transfer Payments Growth** | BEA | Monthly | Coincident | Automatic stabilizers |

#### Derived Impulse Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fiscal Impulse (ppts GDP)** | Change in Structural Deficit | >+1 ppt | Expansionary |
| **Government GDP Contribution** | G Component × Weight | <0 ppts | Fiscal drag |
| **Deficit Change (YoY)** | Current - Prior Year | >+$300B | Significant expansion |
| **Transfer Growth YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | >8% | Countercyclical |

#### Regime Thresholds: Fiscal Impulse

| **Indicator** | **Contractionary** | **Neutral** | **Expansionary** | **Stimulus** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fiscal Impulse** | <-1 ppt | -1 to +0.5 ppts | +0.5 to +1.5 ppts | >+1.5 ppts |
| **Govt GDP Contribution** | <-0.3 ppts | -0.3 to +0.3 | +0.3 to +0.8 | >+0.8 ppts |
| **Transfer Growth** | <3% | 3-6% | 6-10% | >10% |

**The Persistent Impulse:** Fiscal impulse at **+0.8 ppts** (Q4 2025)—still expansionary despite high rates. Government contributing **+0.4 ppts** to GDP. The deficit isn't just a debt problem—it's actively supporting growth. When (if) fiscal consolidation arrives, GDP takes a hit. The soft landing assumes no fiscal cliff.

---

### F. RECEIPTS & TAX POLICY (The Revenue Side)

Tax receipts are **cyclically sensitive**—they boom with profits and wages, bust with recessions. Tax policy changes create step-function impacts.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Total Federal Receipts** | FGRECPT | Monthly | Lagging | Total tax revenue |
| **Individual Income Taxes** | Treasury | Monthly | Lagging | Largest source (~50%) |
| **Corporate Income Taxes** | Treasury | Monthly | **Leads profits 1-2 qtrs** | Profit proxy |
| **Payroll Taxes** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Employment proxy |
| **Customs Duties** | Treasury | Monthly | Coincident | Trade policy impact |
| **Receipts/GDP** | Derived | Quarterly | Lagging | Tax burden |
| **Effective Corporate Tax Rate** | CBO | Annual | Lagging | Actual rate paid |

#### Derived Receipt Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Receipts YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <0% | Revenue shortfall |
| **Corporate Tax YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <-10% | Profit weakness |
| **Individual Tax YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <+3% | Wage/capital gains weak |
| **Receipts/GDP Gap** | Current - Historical Avg (17.5%) | <-1 ppt | Revenue gap |

#### Regime Thresholds: Receipts

| **Indicator** | **Shortfall** | **Weak** | **Normal** | **Strong** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Total Receipts YoY%** | <-5% | -5% to +3% | +3% to +8% | >+8% |
| **Corporate Tax YoY%** | <-15% | -15% to 0% | 0% to +10% | >+10% |
| **Receipts/GDP** | <16% | 16-17% | 17-18.5% | >18.5% |

**The Revenue Gap:** Total receipts at **$4.6T** (FY2025 tracking)—up +3.2% YoY but well below spending growth (+7.8%). Receipts/GDP at **16.3%**—below 17.5% historical average. Corporate taxes volatile (capital gains dependent). The 2017 TCJA provisions expiring 2025 creates policy uncertainty. Extension = higher deficits. Expiration = tax cliff for households.

---

### G. DEBT CEILING & POLITICAL RISK (The Manufactured Crisis)

The debt ceiling is a **self-inflicted wound**—a political constraint that creates artificial crisis risk. X-date dynamics matter for markets.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Debt Ceiling Level** | Treasury | Event-driven | N/A | Statutory limit |
| **X-Date Estimate** | CBO/Bipartisan Policy | Periodic | **Leading 1-6 mo** | Default deadline |
| **Extraordinary Measures Used** | Treasury | Weekly | Coincident | Headroom consumed |
| **TGA Balance** | Treasury | Daily | Coincident | Cash cushion |
| **Bills Maturing Near X-Date** | Treasury | Event-driven | Coincident | Rollover risk |
| **CDS on US Treasuries** | Market | Daily | Leading | Default probability pricing |

#### Derived Political Risk Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Days to X-Date** | X-Date - Today | <60 days | Crisis zone |
| **TGA Cushion** | TGA Balance / Daily Outlays | <30 days | Cash stress |
| **EM Headroom** | Remaining Extraordinary Measures | <$100B | Near exhaustion |
| **1Y CDS Spread** | Current | >50 bps | Market pricing risk |

#### Regime Thresholds: Political Risk

| **Indicator** | **Crisis** | **Elevated** | **Normal** | **Clear** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Days to X-Date** | <30 | 30-90 | 90-180 | >180 or suspended |
| **TGA Balance** | <$100B | $100-300B | $300-600B | >$600B |
| **1Y US CDS** | >75 bps | 30-75 bps | 10-30 bps | <10 bps |

**The Current Ceiling:** Debt ceiling reinstated **January 2, 2025** at ~$36.1T. Treasury using extraordinary measures. X-date estimate: **Q3 2025** (July-September range). TGA balance at **$680B** (adequate cushion for now). New administration/Congress must act. History says they wait until the last minute. Markets price stress 30-60 days before X-date.

---

### H. TERM PREMIUM & MARKET PRICING (The Honest Signal)

The term premium is what investors demand **above expected short rates** to hold long-duration Treasuries. It reflects supply/demand imbalance, inflation uncertainty, and fiscal risk.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **10Y Term Premium (ACM Model)** | NY Fed | Daily | Coincident | Duration risk compensation |
| **10Y Term Premium (KW Model)** | Fed | Daily | Coincident | Alternative estimate |
| **10Y-2Y Spread** | FRED | Daily | Coincident | Curve shape proxy |
| **10Y-3M Spread** | FRED | Daily | Leading 6-12 mo | Recession signal |
| **5Y5Y Forward Rate** | FRED | Daily | Coincident | Long-term rate expectations |
| **Real 10Y Yield (TIPS)** | FRED | Daily | Coincident | Real return demanded |
| **30Y Yield** | FRED | Daily | Coincident | Ultra-long demand |

#### Derived Term Premium Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Term Premium Level** | ACM 10Y TP | >+50 bps | Supply/fiscal risk priced |
| **Term Premium Change (6M)** | Current - 6M Ago | >+50 bps | Rapid repricing |
| **Real Rate vs Neutral** | Real 10Y - r* (~0.5%) | >+150 bps | Very restrictive |
| **30Y-10Y Spread** | 30Y - 10Y | >+40 bps | Duration supply premium |

#### Regime Thresholds: Term Premium

| **Indicator** | **Compressed** | **Normal** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **10Y Term Premium** | <-25 bps | -25 to +50 bps | +50 to +150 bps | >+150 bps |
| **Real 10Y Yield** | <0% | 0-1.5% | 1.5-2.5% | >2.5% |
| **10Y-2Y Spread** | <-50 bps | -50 to +50 bps | +50 to +150 bps | >+150 bps |

**The Repricing Underway:** 10Y term premium at **+25 bps** (Jan 2026)—up from **-50 bps** (Jan 2024). The market is **finally** pricing fiscal risk. But we're nowhere near equilibrium. Historical average term premium: **+100-150 bps**. At $2T annual deficits, we should be **+150 bps or higher**. The repricing has started. It's not done. 10Y yields going to **5.5%+** is the base case as term premium normalizes.

## Government Pillar Composite Index (GCI-Gov)

### Formula

The Government Pillar Composite synthesizes deficit, debt, interest, issuance, and term premium into a single fiscal stress indicator:

```
GCI-Gov = 0.25 × z(Deficit_GDP)
        + 0.20 × z(Interest_Outlays)
        + 0.15 × z(Debt_GDP)
        + 0.15 × z(Term_Premium)
        + 0.10 × z(Quarterly_Issuance)
        + 0.10 × z(-Receipts_YoY)              # Inverted (falling receipts = stress)
        + 0.05 × z(-Foreign_Holdings_Pct)      # Inverted (falling = less demand)
```

**Component Weighting Rationale:**
- **Deficit/GDP (25%):** Annual flow, primary fiscal stance indicator
- **Interest/Outlays (20%):** Compounding burden, crowding out
- **Debt/GDP (15%):** Stock accumulation, sustainability
- **Term Premium (15%):** Market's honest signal on fiscal risk
- **Quarterly Issuance (10%):** Near-term supply pressure
- **Receipts YoY (10%):** Revenue health (inverted)
- **Foreign Holdings % (5%):** Demand side (inverted)

### Interpretation

| **GCI-Gov Range** | **Regime** | **Duration Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | Fiscal Crisis | Maximum underweight duration | Yields spiking |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Stress | Underweight duration | Term premium repricing |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | Neutral duration | Fiscal drag building |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Normal | Standard allocation | Sustainable path |
| < -0.5 | Fiscal Health | Overweight duration | Surplus/consolidation |

### Historical Calibration

| **Period** | **GCI-Gov** | **Regime** | **Outcome (12M Forward)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dec 2007** | +0.3 | Normal | Pre-crisis, deficits about to explode |
| **Dec 2009** | +1.8 | Crisis | 10% deficit, emergency spending |
| **Dec 2013** | +0.6 | Elevated | Sequester, partial consolidation |
| **Dec 2019** | +0.4 | Normal | Pre-COVID, stable deficits |
| **Dec 2020** | +2.1 | Crisis | COVID stimulus, 15% deficit |
| **Dec 2023** | +0.9 | Elevated | Post-COVID normalization stalled |
| **Dec 2025** | **+1.1** | **High Stress** | **Fiscal Dominance regime** |

**Current Assessment (Dec 2025):** GCI-Gov at **+1.1** places fiscal conditions in "High Stress" regime—not crisis (that's reserved for 10%+ deficits), but unsustainable:
- **Deficit/GDP at 7.2%** (wartime levels in peacetime)
- **Interest/Outlays at 16%** (larger than defense)
- **Debt/GDP at 122%** (highest since WWII)
- **Term premium at +25 bps** (rising from -50 bps, more to go)
- **Quarterly issuance at $680B** (supply overwhelming demand)
- **Foreign holdings at 24%** (declining, domestic must absorb)

This is **Fiscal Dominance**—the regime where fiscal policy overwhelms monetary policy. The Fed can't tighten enough to offset $2T annual deficits.

**The Critical Chain:**

**1. Deficit trajectory set by policy** → 6-18 months later → **Issuance requirements crystallize**
**2. Quarterly refunding announced** → 3 months later → **Auctions test demand**
**3. Auctions struggle (tails, low B/C)** → 1-3 months later → **Term premium rises**
**4. Term premium rises** → Immediate → **All long-duration assets reprice**
**5. Higher rates** → 6-12 months later → **Interest expense rises, deficit widens (vicious cycle)**

We're in the middle of this cascade. Deficits locked in. Issuance ramping. Auctions showing strain. Term premium rising. The vicious cycle is engaged.

## Integration with Three-Engine Framework

### Pillar 8 → Pillar 3 (Growth)

Fiscal policy directly impacts **GDP through government spending and transfer payments**:

```
Fiscal Impulse → Government GDP Contribution →
Transfer Payments → Consumer Income →
Private Consumption → GDP Growth
```

**Current Linkage:** Fiscal impulse at +0.8 ppts. Government contributing +0.4 ppts to GDP. Without fiscal support, GDP would be +2.1% instead of +2.5%. Fiscal policy is **the** support for the soft landing.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** If fiscal consolidation occurs (deficit cuts, spending restraint), expect **-0.5 to -1.0 ppts** GDP drag. When **GCI-Gov > +1.0** (high stress) AND **GCI < -0.3** (growth weak), fiscal austerity would tip economy into recession.

---

### Pillar 8 → Pillar 2 (Prices)

Deficit spending is **demand stimulus**—it can be inflationary:

```
Deficit Spending → Aggregate Demand ↑ →
Output Gap Narrows → Inflation Pressure ↑
```

**Current Linkage:** 7.2% deficit is stimulative—it's fighting the Fed's restrictive policy. Core PCE stuck at 3.2% partly because fiscal policy is offsetting monetary tightening. The Fed is pushing on a string while Treasury is pulling.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** Fiscal dominance means **monetary policy loses effectiveness**. If **GCI-Gov > +1.0** (high fiscal stress) AND **PCI > +0.5** (elevated inflation), the Fed can't win—inflation stays sticky because deficits keep demand elevated.

---

### Pillar 8 → Pillar 10 (Plumbing)

Treasury issuance affects **reserve dynamics and dealer balance sheets**:

```
Treasury Issuance ↑ → Private Sector Absorbs →
Reserves Drain → Dealer Balance Sheets Stretch →
Repo Rates Rise → Financial Conditions Tighten
```

**Current Linkage:** $2T+ annual issuance must be absorbed by private sector (Fed in QT). This drains reserves, stretches dealer balance sheets, and tightens plumbing. LCI at -0.8 partly because Treasury supply is crowding out.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **GCI-Gov > +1.0** (heavy issuance) AND **LCI < -0.5** (thin liquidity cushion), plumbing stress emerges. The system can't absorb Treasury supply without dislocations.

---

### Pillar 8 → Pillar 9 (Financial)

Treasury yields set the **risk-free floor** for all credit pricing:

```
Term Premium ↑ → Treasury Yields ↑ →
Corporate Bond Yields ↑ → Credit Spreads (may widen) →
Corporate Borrowing Cost ↑ → Investment ↓
```

**Current Linkage:** 10Y at 4.60% sets floor. IG corporate yields at 5.5%. HY at 7.5%. Every 50 bps rise in Treasuries flows through to corporate borrowing costs. Fiscal risk is repriced into all credit.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **term premium rises > +50 bps**, expect corporate bond issuance to slow, M&A to pause, and leveraged borrowers to face stress. Fiscal risk becomes corporate risk.

### Pillar 8 → Pillar 1 (Labor)

Government is a **major employer** (22M federal, state, local) and transfer payments support household income:

```
Fiscal Consolidation → Government Employment Cuts →
Transfer Payment Reductions → Household Income ↓ →
Consumer Spending ↓ → Private Layoffs
```

**Current Linkage:** Government employment at **22.9M** (all levels)—steady. Federal transfers at **$4.2T** annually (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, UI). Any significant fiscal consolidation would hit both employment and income.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** Fiscal austerity (**deficit cuts > 2% of GDP**) would add **+0.3-0.5** to LFI (labor fragility) through direct and indirect channels. Fiscal health requires labor pain.

### Narrative Synthesis

We've entered **Fiscal Dominance**—the regime where fiscal policy overwhelms monetary policy.

**The Math:**
- **$1.9T deficit** (FY2025) at **7.2% of GDP**—wartime levels in peacetime
- **$1.1T interest expense**—now **larger than defense**, growing 20%+ annually
- **$28.2T debt** (public) at **122% of GDP**—highest since WWII
- **$2.1T annual issuance** required—market struggling to absorb
- **$8.5T maturity wall** in next 12 months—rolling at higher rates

**The Vicious Cycle:**
1. Deficits require issuance
2. Issuance overwhelms demand
3. Term premium rises
4. Yields rise
5. Interest expense rises
6. Deficit widens
7. Return to Step 1

**The Fed's Dilemma:**
- Monetary policy **cannot offset** fiscal policy at this scale
- Every 100 bps of Fed hikes adds **~$280B** to annual interest expense (with lag)
- The Fed is tightening; the deficit is stimulating
- **Fiscal policy wins**—it's bigger

**The Honest Signal:**
- Term premium at **+25 bps**, up from **-50 bps** (Jan 2024)
- Historical equilibrium: **+100-150 bps**
- At $2T annual deficits, should be **+150-200 bps**
- 10Y yield going to **5.5%+** as term premium normalizes
- This repricing is **inevitable**—only timing uncertain

**Cross-Pillar Confirmation:**
- **Growth Pillar:** Fiscal impulse +0.8 ppts—deficit is supporting GDP (for now)
- **Prices Pillar:** Deficit stimulus fighting Fed tightening—inflation stays sticky
- **Plumbing Pillar:** Treasury supply draining reserves, stretching dealers
- **Financial Pillar:** Rising Treasuries repricing all credit

**MRI (Macro Risk Index):** Government contributes **+1.1 (GCI-Gov)** to composite—the **largest single contributor** to macro risk. Fiscal Dominance is the 2026 theme.

## Invalidation Criteria

### Bull Case (Fiscal Improvement) Invalidation Thresholds

If the following occur **over 12+ months**, the bearish fiscal thesis is invalidated:

✅ **Deficit/GDP** drops below **5%** (significant consolidation)
✅ **Primary balance** reaches **surplus** (structural improvement)
✅ **Receipts/GDP** exceeds **18%** (revenue recovery)
✅ **Term premium** drops below **0 bps** (market comfortable)
✅ **Foreign holdings %** stabilizes above **28%** (demand returning)
✅ **GCI-Gov** drops below **+0.5** (normal regime)

**Action if Invalidated:** Extend duration. Overweight **long Treasuries** (TLT), **IG credit** (LQD). Fiscal improvement = lower yields = duration rally.

### Bear Case (Fiscal Crisis) Confirmation Thresholds

If the following occur, fiscal stress is **escalating toward crisis**:

🔴 **Deficit/GDP** exceeds **10%** (outside recession)
🔴 **Term premium** exceeds **+150 bps** (fiscal risk fully priced)
🔴 **10Y yield** exceeds **6%** (sustained)
🔴 **Auction failures** (bid-to-cover < 2.0 on benchmark)
🔴 **Debt ceiling breach** (technical default)
🔴 **Foreign holdings** drop below **20%** (buyer strike)
🔴 **GCI-Gov** exceeds **+1.5** (crisis regime)

**Action if Confirmed:** Maximum short duration. Overweight **T-bills** (SHV, BIL), **cash** (SGOV), **gold** (GLD), **TIPS** (TIP). Avoid all long-duration exposure. Consider curve steepeners.

## The Fiscal Dominance Framework

### What Is Fiscal Dominance?

Fiscal Dominance is the regime where:
1. **Deficits are so large** that monetary policy cannot offset their stimulative effect
2. **Debt service costs** are so high that rate hikes worsen the fiscal situation
3. **Treasury supply** is so heavy that it sets long-end yields regardless of Fed policy
4. **The term premium** must rise to clear the market—this is the "honest signal"

### Historical Precedents

| **Period** | **Characteristics** | **Resolution** |
|---|---|---|
| **1940s (US)** | War debt 120% GDP, Fed pegged rates | Financial repression, inflation |
| **1970s (UK)** | IMF bailout, fiscal crisis | Austerity, Thatcher reforms |
| **1990s (Japan)** | Debt spiral, deflation | QE, yield curve control, stagnation |
| **2010s (Euro)** | Sovereign debt crisis | ECB intervention, fiscal rules |
| **2020s (US)** | COVID debt, structural deficits | **TBD—we're living it** |

### The Three Possible Resolutions

**1. Fiscal Consolidation (Austerity)**
- Cut spending, raise taxes, reduce deficit
- **GDP cost:** -1 to -2% growth drag
- **Political cost:** Extremely high
- **Probability:** Low (~15%)

**2. Financial Repression**
- Keep rates below inflation, inflate away debt
- Requires yield curve control or similar
- **Saver cost:** Negative real returns for years
- **Probability:** Medium (~35%)

**3. Repricing (Market Forces)**
- Term premium rises to +150-200 bps
- 10Y yields go to 5.5-6.5%
- **Cost:** Higher borrowing costs, possible recession
- **Probability:** High (~50%)

**Our Base Case:** Repricing is the most likely near-term resolution. The market is beginning to demand compensation for fiscal risk. Term premium is the honest signal—and it's rising.

## Conclusion: The $35 Trillion Elephant

Government isn't policy. It's **$6.5 trillion in annual spending**, **$35 trillion in debt**, and **$2 trillion in annual issuance**. It's the largest borrower on Earth, and it's crowding out everything else.

**Current State:**
- **GCI-Gov +1.1** (High Stress Regime)
- **Deficit/GDP 7.2%** (wartime levels)
- **Interest/Outlays 16%** (larger than defense)
- **Debt/GDP 122%** (highest since WWII)
- **Term premium +25 bps** (rising from -50 bps, more to go)
- **$2.1T annual issuance** (market struggling to absorb)

**The Fiscal Dominance Reality:**
- The Fed can hike. Treasury will keep issuing.
- The Fed can do QT. Treasury issuance will overwhelm.
- The Fed can talk tough. The deficit will keep stimulating.
- **Fiscal policy is the dominant force.** Monetary policy is the margin.

**The Honest Signal:**
- Term premium must rise to +150 bps to clear the market
- 10Y yields going to 5.5%+ is the base case
- This repricing will affect **all** long-duration assets
- The repricing has started. It's not done.

**Cross-Pillar Context:** Fiscal stress (**GCI-Gov +1.1**) is the **backdrop** for everything else. Labor fragility (**LFI +0.93**) may require rate cuts, but fiscal dynamics keep long rates elevated. Inflation (**PCI +0.7**) stays sticky because deficits keep demand elevated. Growth (**GCI -0.4**) is supported by fiscal impulse—until it isn't.

**The 2026 Theme:** Fiscal Dominance. The term premium. The repricing. It's happening now.

**That's our view from the Watch. Until next time, we'll be sure to keep the light on....**
