## Pillar-to-Commodity Translation

### Prices Pillar (PCI) → Inflation Hedge

| PCI Range | Regime | Commodity Stance | Preferred |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| > +1.0 | High Inflation | **Overweight** | GLD, DBC, TIPS |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | Tactical allocation | GLD |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | On Target | Neutral | Market weight |
| < -0.5 | Deflationary | **Underweight** | Avoid |

### Growth Pillar (GCI) → Demand Signal

| GCI Range | Regime | Industrial Commodities | Energy |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|--------|
| > +0.5 | Expansion | Overweight (DBB, CPER) | Overweight |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| < -0.5 | Contraction | **Underweight** | Underweight |

### Dollar Channel

| DXY Direction | Impact | Trade |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| DXY falling | Bullish commodities | Add DBC, GLD |
| DXY rising | Bearish commodities | Reduce exposure |
| DXY < 100 | Significant tailwind | Overweight |
| DXY > 105 | Significant headwind | Underweight |

## Gold Framework (Primary Commodity Allocation)

### Gold Drivers

1. **Real Rates** (inverse): Lower real rates = higher gold
2. **Dollar** (inverse): Weaker dollar = higher gold
3. **Uncertainty**: Geopolitical/financial stress = higher gold
4. **Central Bank Demand**: Structural bid from EM central banks

### Real Rate → Gold Relationship

| 10Y Real Rate | Gold Stance |
|---------------|-------------|
| > +2.0% | Underweight |
| +1.0 to +2.0% | Neutral |
| 0 to +1.0% | Overweight |
| < 0% | **Strong overweight** |

### Gold Regime Matrix

| Real Rates | Dollar | Gold Signal |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Falling | Falling | **Strong Buy** |
| Falling | Rising | Buy (real rates dominate) |
| Rising | Falling | Neutral |
| Rising | Rising | **Sell** |

### Gold Allocation by MRI

| MRI Range | Gold Allocation |
|-----------|-----------------|
| < +0.5 | 0-3% |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | 3-5% |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | 5-8% |
| > +1.5 | 8-12% |

---

## Energy Framework

### Oil Drivers

1. **Global Growth** (GCI): Demand signal
2. **OPEC+ Policy**: Supply management
3. **Inventories**: Weekly EIA data
4. **Geopolitics**: Supply disruption risk

### Oil → Inflation Pass-Through

| WTI Level | CPI Impact | Signal |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| > $100 | +0.3-0.5 pp to headline | Inflationary |
| $75-100 | Neutral | Baseline |
| $60-75 | -0.1-0.2 pp | Disinflationary |
| < $60 | Demand destruction signal | Deflationary |

### Energy ETF Preference

**Avoid direct commodity ETFs (USO, UNG)** due to:
- Contango roll drag (can be 5-15% annually)
- Tracking error
- K-1 tax complexity

**Prefer energy equities (XLE, XOP)** because:
- No roll drag
- Dividend income
- Operational leverage to oil prices
- Better liquidity

## Industrial Metals as Growth Signal

### Copper ("Dr. Copper")

Copper demand is ~50% from China and highly cyclical. Copper prices often lead global industrial production.

| Copper Signal | Implication |
|---------------|-------------|
| Copper up, equities up | Confirmed expansion |
| Copper up, equities flat | Early cycle recovery |
| Copper down, equities up | Divergence warning |
| Copper down, equities down | Confirmed contraction |

### When to Own Industrial Metals

- GCI > 0 AND PMIs expanding → DBB, CPER
- China stimulus announced → Copper rally likely
- Infrastructure bill passage → Metals demand

## Position Sizing

### Commodity Allocation by Regime

| MRI Regime | Total Commodities | Gold | Energy | Industrial |
|------------|-------------------|------|--------|------------|
| Low Risk | 5-10% | 2-3% | 2-4% | 1-3% |
| Neutral | 5-8% | 2-3% | 2-3% | 1-2% |
| Elevated | 8-12% | 3-5% | 3-5% | 2-2% |
| High Risk | 10-15% | 5-8% | 3-5% | 2-2% |
| Crisis | 8-15% | 8-12% | 0-3% | 0% |

### Roll Yield Consideration

For direct commodity ETFs, check the futures curve:
- **Backwardation** (near > far): Positive roll yield, ETF outperforms spot
- **Contango** (near < far): Negative roll yield, ETF underperforms spot
