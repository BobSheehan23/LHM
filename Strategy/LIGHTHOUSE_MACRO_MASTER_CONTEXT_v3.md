## Lighthouse Macro Positioning

**Tagline:** "MACRO, ILLUMINATED."

**Mission:** Institutional-grade macro research serving hedge funds, CIOs, central banks, and allocators

**Core Differentiation:**

| **Attribute** | **Lighthouse Approach** | **Consensus Approach** |
|---|---|---|
| **Signal Source** | 12 Macro Pillars → Proprietary Indicators | Headlines, lagging data |
| **Analytical Framework** | Three-Engine System (Macro Dynamics, Monetary Mechanics, Market Structure) | Single-dimensional analysis |
| **Position Sizing** | Conviction-weighted (7-20% per position) | Equal-weighted |
| **Concentration** | 3-5 high-conviction bets | 30+ marginal positions |
| **Cash Treatment** | Active position (30-100% valid) | Residual drag |
| **Risk Framework** | Dual stops (thesis + price) | Single trailing stop |
| **Timeframe** | 3-6 month tactical core | Arbitrary calendar |

**Philosophy:** "Flows > Stocks. We measure labor market deterioration 6-9 months before unemployment rises. We track Fed plumbing stress before funding markets break. We identify credit complacency before spreads widen. We see structure break before fundamentals confirm. By the time everyone knows, it's too late."

---

## The Edge

**The Honest Signal:** Leading indicators embedded in economic flows tell the truth before lagging data confirms it.

**Key Examples:**
- **Labor:** Quits rate collapses 6-9 months before unemployment rises
- **Liquidity:** RRP drainage signals reserve scarcity before funding stress
- **Credit:** Labor fragility + tight spreads = pre-widening setup
- **Structure:** Breadth divergence precedes price breakdown by 2-4 months

**The Iceberg Metaphor:** Massive underlying data/code infrastructure powering elegant, sharp, simple signals. Users see the clean output; the complexity is hidden below.

## ENGINE 1: MACRO DYNAMICS (Pillars 1-7)

### The "Household to Business" Transmission Chain

```
Labor (Source) → Consumer (Engine) → Housing (Collateral) →
Growth (Response) → Prices (Result) → Trade (Adjustment)
```

---

## PILLAR 1: LABOR — The Economic Genome

### The Labor Transmission Chain

Labor isn't just employment data. It's the economic genome—the code that determines whether the expansion continues or the system resets. The transmission mechanism operates through cascading flows:

```
Worker Confidence → Job-Switching Behavior → Wage Pressure →
Income Growth → Spending Capacity → Corporate Pricing Power →
Profit Margins → Hiring Decisions → Worker Confidence
```

**The Insight:** This isn't a linear chain. It's a feedback loop. When workers stop quitting, they're not being prudent. They're seeing something management hasn't admitted yet. The quits rate is the economy's truth serum—it strips away the narrative and exposes the underlying fragility. Six to nine months before the unemployment rate rises, quits collapse. Every. Single. Time.

### Why Labor Leads Everything

Labor is the **alpha generator** in the framework for a simple reason: it sits upstream of every other economic flow.

**The Cascade:**

**1. Labor → Consumer:** Income determines spending capacity (1-3 month lag)
**2. Labor → Credit:** Employment stress precedes default risk (3-6 month lag)
**3. Labor → Housing:** Job stability drives home-buying decisions (6-9 month lag)
**4. Labor → Growth:** Hours worked contracts before output falls (2-4 month lag)
**5. Labor → Prices:** Wage pressure drives services inflation (persistent)

### Primary Indicators

#### A. Employment Flows (The Core Signal)

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **JOLTS Quits Rate** | JTSQUR | Monthly | **Primary leading indicator** | Worker confidence barometer |

| **Job-Hopper Premium** | Atlanta Fed | Monthly | **Leading 3-6 mo** | Job-switching premium |

#### C. Labor Supply

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Prime-Age LFPR (25-54)** | LNS11300060 | Monthly | Structural | Core workforce participation |
| **U6 Underemployment** | U6RATE | Monthly | Lagging | Broad slack measure |

### Labor Pillar Composite Index (LPI)

```
LPI = 0.20 × z(Quits_Rate)
    + 0.15 × z(Hires_Quits_Ratio)
    + 0.15 × z(-Long_Term_Unemployed_Share)   # Inverted (high = weak)
    + 0.15 × z(-Initial_Claims_4wk_MA)         # Inverted
    + 0.10 × z(Prime_Age_LFPR)
    + 0.10 × z(Avg_Weekly_Hours_Mfg)
    + 0.10 × z(-Temp_Help_YoY)                 # Inverted (declining = weak)
    + 0.05 × z(Job_Hopper_Premium)
```

### Interpretation

| **LPI Range** | **Regime** | **Labor Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Boom | Overweight cyclicals | Full employment, wage pressure |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Healthy | Neutral | Sustainable growth |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | Slight caution | Decelerating |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Weak | Underweight consumer discretionary | Stress emerging |
| < -1.0 | Crisis | Defensive positioning | Recession confirmed |

### Labor Fragility Index (LFI)

```
LFI = 0.35 × z(Long_Duration_Unemployment_Share)
    + 0.35 × z(-Quits_Rate)                    # Inverted
    + 0.30 × z(-Hires_to_Quits_Ratio)          # Inverted
```

| **LFI Range** | **Regime** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| < 0.0 | Healthy | Labor market robust |
| 0.0 to +0.5 | Neutral | Balanced conditions |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | **Fragility developing** |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High | Pre-recessionary |
| > +1.5 | Critical | Recession imminent |

|---|---|---|
| **Quits Rate** | <2.0% | Pre-recessionary |
| **Long-Term Unemployed Share** | >22% | Fragility building |
| **Temp Help YoY%** | <-3% | Recession signal |
| **Job-Hopper Premium** | <0.5 ppts | Late-cycle |
| **Unemployment Rate** | >4.5% | Stress emerging |

## PILLAR 2: PRICES — The Inflation Regime

### The Inflation Transmission Chain

Inflation isn't a number—it's a regime.

```
Supply Shocks → Goods Inflation → Demand Response →
Wage Pressure → Services Inflation → Inflation Expectations →
Fed Response → Financial Conditions → Demand Destruction →
Supply Shocks (if overtightening)
```

**The Insight:** The "last mile" is structural. Goods disinflation completes quickly. Services inflation is sticky. Shelter lags reality by 12-18 months. The Fed flies blind with lagging data.

### Primary Indicators

#### A. Core Inflation

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core PCE** | PCEPILFE | Monthly | **Fed's official target** |
| **Core CPI** | CPILFESL | Monthly | Primary Fed watch metric |

#### B. Goods vs Services

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Goods CPI** | CUSR0000SACL1E | Supply chain/demand signal |
| **Core Services CPI** | CUSR0000SASLE | Wage-driven inflation |
| **Services ex-Shelter** | Derived | "Supercore" (wage signal) |

#### C. Shelter Inflation

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shelter CPI** | BLS | **Lags 12-18 mo** | 34% of CPI weight |
| **Zillow Rent Index** | Zillow | **Leads CPI by 12 mo** | Real-time market rents |

#### D. Inflation Expectations

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **5Y5Y Forward Inflation** | FRED | **Fed's anchor gauge** |
| **UMich 1Y Expectations** | UMich | Consumer short-term expectations |

### Prices Pillar Composite Index (PCI)

```
PCI = 0.30 × z(Core_PCE_3M_Ann)
    + 0.20 × z(Services_ex_Shelter_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Shelter_CPI_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Sticky_CPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(5Y5Y_Forward_Inflation)
    + 0.10 × z(-Goods_CPI_YoY)           # Inverted
```

### Interpretation

| **PCI Range** | **Regime** | **Fed Stance** |
|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | Inflation Crisis | Emergency Hikes |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Inflation | Restrictive |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | **Cautious** |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | On Target | Neutral |
| < -0.5 | Deflationary | Easing |

---

## PILLAR 3: GROWTH — The Macro Multiplier

### The Growth Transmission Chain

Growth isn't GDP. It's the **velocity of economic metabolism**—the speed at which labor, capital, and innovation combine to produce output.

```
Demand Shock → Production Response → Inventory Adjustment →
Capital Investment → Hiring Decisions → Income Growth →
Demand Shock (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Growth is a **second derivative** phenomenon. What matters isn't the level—it's the *change in the rate of change*. When industrial production *decelerates* from +3.5% to +1.2%, that's a **momentum break** that precedes recession by 6-9 months.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real GDP** | GDPC1 | Lagging 1-2 qtrs | Inflation-adjusted output |
| **GDI-GDP Gap** | Derived | **Leading 2-4 qtrs** | Recession signal |
| **Industrial Production** | INDPRO | **Leads GDP 1-2 qtrs** | Factory output |
| **IP: Manufacturing** | IPMAN | Leads GDP 2-3 qtrs | 75% of IP |
| **Core Capital Goods Orders** | NEWORDER | **Leads capex 4-8 mo** | CEO forward commitment |

### Growth Pillar Composite Index (GCI)

```
GCI = 0.25 × z(Industrial_Production_YoY)
    + 0.20 × z(ISM_Manufacturing)
    + 0.15 × z(Core_Capital_Goods_Orders_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Aggregate_Weekly_Hours_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(Real_Retail_Sales_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(Housing_Starts_YoY)
    + 0.05 × z(-GDI_GDP_Spread)
```

### Interpretation

| **GCI Range** | **Regime** | **Cyclical Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Strong Growth | Overweight cyclicals | Expansion acceleration |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Above Trend | Moderate cyclical | Healthy growth |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Trend | Balanced | Sustainable pace |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Below Trend | Underweight cyclicals | Contraction risk |
| < -1.0 | Contraction | Defensive | Recession confirmed |

## PILLAR 4: HOUSING — The Frozen Collateral

### The Housing Transmission Chain

Housing isn't shelter—it's the **financial system's collateral backbone**.

```
Mortgage Rates → Affordability → Purchase Demand →
Home Prices → Household Wealth → Consumer Spending →
Collateral Values → Credit Availability →
Mortgage Rates (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Housing is a **leveraged bet on rates and demographics**. When mortgage rates spike 400 bps in 18 months, transaction volumes collapse. But prices don't fall proportionally—locked-in sellers refuse to list, creating the "golden handcuffs" phenomenon.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Building Permits** | FRED (PERMIT) | **Leads starts 1-2 mo** | Future pipeline |
| **Housing Starts** | FRED (HOUST) | **Leads GDP 6-9 mo** | New construction |
| **Existing Home Sales** | NAR | Coincident | Market liquidity |
| **Case-Shiller HPI** | S&P/CoreLogic | Lagging | Wealth effect anchor |
| **30Y Mortgage Rate** | Freddie Mac | Driver | Affordability constraint |
| **Affordability Index** | NAR | Derived | 100 = median income qualifies |

### Housing Pillar Composite Index (HCI)

```
HCI = 0.20 × z(Housing_Starts_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Existing_Home_Sales_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(NAHB_Index)
    + 0.15 × z(-Months_Supply)
    + 0.10 × z(HPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(-30Y_Mortgage_Rate)
    + 0.10 × z(MBA_Purchase_Index_YoY)
    + 0.05 × z(-Mortgage_Delinquency)
```

### Interpretation

| **HCI Range** | **Regime** | **Housing Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Housing Boom | Overweight homebuilders | Transaction surge |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Healthy | Neutral | Sustainable activity |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral/Frozen | Slight underweight | Rate-constrained |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Weak | Underweight housing | Demand destruction |
| < -1.0 | Crisis | Avoid housing exposure | Price correction underway |

## PILLAR 5: CONSUMER — The 68% Anchor

### The Consumer Transmission Chain

The consumer isn't a sector—it's **68% of GDP**.

```
Employment Security → Income Growth → Confidence →
Spending Decisions → Credit Usage → Retail Sales →
Corporate Revenue → Hiring Decisions →
Employment Security (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** The consumer is a **lagging indicator pretending to be coincident**. By the time retail sales collapse, labor already cracked 6-9 months prior.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Real PCE** | FRED (PCEC96) | Inflation-adjusted spending |
| **Personal Saving Rate** | FRED (PSAVERT) | Fuel tank gauge |
| **Credit Card Delinquency** | Fed | Early stress signal |
| **CB Consumer Confidence** | Conf Board | Headline sentiment |
| **CB Expectations** | Conf Board | **Leads recession 6-9 mo** |

### Consumer Pillar Composite Index (CCI)

```
CCI = 0.25 × z(Real_PCE_YoY)
    + 0.20 × z(Personal_Saving_Rate)
    + 0.15 × z(-Credit_Card_Delinquency)
    + 0.15 × z(CB_Expectations)
    + 0.10 × z(Real_DPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(-Debt_Service_Ratio)
    + 0.05 × z(Card_Spending_YoY)
```

### Interpretation

| **CCI Range** | **Regime** | **Discretionary Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Consumer Boom | Overweight discretionary, travel | Full expansion |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Healthy | Neutral discretionary | Sustainable growth |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral/Fatigued | Slight underweight | Deceleration |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Stressed | Underweight discretionary, overweight staples | Demand destruction |
| < -1.0 | Crisis | Maximum defensive (staples, discount) | Recession confirmed |

---

## PILLAR 6: BUSINESS — The Transmission Mechanism

### The Business Transmission Chain

Business activity isn't just corporate earnings—it's the **forward bet on demand**.

```
CEO Confidence → Capex Plans → Equipment Orders →
Production Schedules → Inventory Decisions →
Hiring Plans → Payroll Expansion →
Consumer Income → Final Demand →
CEO Confidence (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Businesses are **leading indicators** because they commit capital 6-18 months before sales materialize.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NFIB Optimism** | NFIB | **Leads GDP 3-6 mo** | 44% of GDP, 48% of employment |
| **Core Capital Goods Orders** | FRED | **Leads capex 4-8 mo** | CEO forward commitment |
| **ISM Manufacturing** | ISM | **Leads IP 2-4 mo** | >50 = expansion |
| **ISM Services** | ISM | Coincident | 80% of economy |
| **Inventory/Sales Ratio** | FRED | **Leads recession 3-6 mo** | Overstocking signal |

### Business Pillar Composite Index (BCI)

```
BCI = 0.20 × z(NFIB_Optimism)
    + 0.20 × z(Core_Capex_Orders_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(ISM_Manufacturing)
    + 0.15 × z(ISM_Services)
    + 0.10 × z(-Inventory_Sales_Ratio)
    + 0.10 × z(SP500_Earnings_YoY)
    + 0.05 × z(-SLOOS_Net_Tightening)
    + 0.05 × z(-HY_Spreads)
```

### Interpretation

| **BCI Range** | **Regime** | **Cyclical Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Business Boom | Overweight industrials, small caps | Full expansion |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Expansion | Neutral cyclicals | Healthy growth |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral/Slowing | Underweight small caps | Deceleration |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Contraction | Avoid small caps, underweight cyclicals | Earnings recession |
| < -1.0 | Crisis | Maximum defensive | Broad recession |

---

## PILLAR 7: TRADE — The Global Margin

### The Trade Transmission Chain

Trade isn't imports and exports—it's the **global margin of adjustment**.

```
Dollar Strength → Import Prices → Domestic Inflation →
Export Competitiveness → Manufacturing Output →
Trade Balance → Capital Flows → Dollar Strength (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Trade is the **pressure release valve** for domestic imbalances. When the U.S. runs a $1T trade deficit, it's exporting demand and importing disinflation.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Trade Balance** | BOPGSTB | Net trade position |
| **Import Price Index** | IMP | Tariff pass-through (**Leads CPI goods 3-6 mo**) |
| **DXY (Dollar Index)** | DTWEXBGS | USD vs major currencies |
| **NY Fed GSCPI** | NY Fed | Global Supply Chain Pressure |

### Trade Pillar Composite Index (TCI)

```
TCI = 0.20 × z(-Import_Price_YoY)
    + 0.20 × z(-Trade_Balance_GDP_Ratio)
    + 0.15 × z(Export_Volume_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(-NY_Fed_GSCPI)
    + 0.10 × z(Container_Volume_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(-DXY_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(-Trade_Policy_Uncertainty)
```

### Interpretation

| **TCI Range** | **Regime** | **Trade Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Trade Tailwind | Overweight exporters, EM | Globalization tailwind |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Favorable | Neutral global exposure | Stable trade conditions |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | Balanced | Mixed conditions |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Headwind | Underweight trade-sensitive | Tariff/dollar drag |
| < -1.0 | Trade Crisis | Maximum defensive | De-globalization shock |

## ENGINE 2: MONETARY MECHANICS (Pillars 8-10)

### The Capacity to Sustain Risk

```
Government (Supply) → Credit (Transmission) → Liquidity (Reservoir)
```

---

## PILLAR 8: GOVERNMENT — The Fiscal Gorilla

### The Fiscal Transmission Chain

Government isn't just policy—it's **trillions in annual spending** and **outstanding debt**.

```
Fiscal Policy → Deficit Spending → Treasury Issuance →
Interest Rates → Private Investment Crowding →
Growth Impact → Tax Receipts →
Deficit (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** **Fiscal Dominance** is the regime where fiscal policy overwhelms monetary policy. The Fed can hike all it wants, but if Treasury is issuing $2T+ annually, the supply of duration crushes bond prices regardless.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Deficit/GDP** | Treasury/CBO | Annual flow |
| **Debt/GDP** | FRED | Stock accumulation |
| **Interest/Outlays** | Treasury | Crowding out gauge |
| **Quarterly Issuance** | Treasury | Supply pressure |
| **10Y Term Premium (ACM)** | NY Fed | **The honest signal** |

### Government Pillar Composite Index (GCI-Gov)

```
GCI-Gov = 0.25 × z(Deficit_GDP)
        + 0.20 × z(Interest_Outlays)
        + 0.15 × z(Debt_GDP)

```

### Interpretation

| **GCI-Gov Range** | **Regime** | **Duration Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | Fiscal Crisis | Maximum underweight duration | Yields spiking |

## PILLAR 9: FINANCIAL — The Transmission Plumbing

### The Financial Transmission Chain

Financial conditions aren't just rates—they're the **plumbing that connects Fed policy to the real economy**.

```
Fed Policy Rate → Bank Funding Costs → Credit Availability →
Lending Standards → Loan Growth → Business Investment →
Hiring → Income → Spending → Fed Policy Rate (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** The Fed sets the policy rate, but **financial conditions determine whether it matters**. When credit spreads are tight and banks are lending freely, restrictive policy is blunted.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **HY OAS** | FRED (BAMLH0A0HYM2) | **Leads defaults 6-9 mo** |
| **IG OAS** | FRED (BAMLC0A0CM) | Leads HY 1-2 mo |
| **10Y-2Y Spread** | FRED (T10Y2Y) | **Leads recession 12-18 mo** |
| **Chicago Fed NFCI** | Chicago Fed | **Leads GDP 2-4 qtrs** |
| **SLOOS Tightening** | Fed | **Leads loan growth 2-4 qtrs** |

### Financial Pillar Composite Index (FCI)

```
FCI = 0.20 × z(-HY_OAS)
    + 0.15 × z(-NFCI)
    + 0.15 × z(Yield_Curve_10Y2Y)
    + 0.15 × z(-Real_Fed_Funds)
    + 0.10 × z(C&I_Loan_Growth)
    + 0.10 × z(-VIX)
    + 0.10 × z(LCI)
    + 0.05 × z(-SLOOS_Tightening)
```

### Interpretation

| **FCI Range** | **Regime** | **Risk Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Very Loose | Overweight risk assets | Financial tailwind |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Loose | Moderate risk-on | Conditions supportive |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | Balanced | Mixed conditions |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Tight | Underweight risk | Conditions headwind |
| < -1.0 | Crisis | Maximum defensive | Financial stress |

### Credit-Labor Gap (CLG)

```
CLG = z(HY_OAS) - z(LFI)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **CLG < -1.0:** Credit spreads too tight for labor reality—spreads should be 100-150 bps wider
- **CLG ~ 0:** Credit and labor aligned
- **CLG > +1.0:** Credit spreads pricing in stress labor doesn't show

## PILLAR 10: PLUMBING (LIQUIDITY) — The Infrastructure

### The Liquidity Transmission Chain

Plumbing isn't just Fed policy—it's the **reservoir** that determines whether monetary policy reaches the real economy.

```
Fed Balance Sheet → Reserves → Bank Balance Sheets →
Dealer Intermediation → Repo Markets →
Money Market Rates → Financial Conditions →
Asset Prices → Real Economy
```

**The Insight:** Liquidity transmits **mechanically**: RRP → Reserves → Dealer Balance Sheets → Repo → Risk Assets. When the RRP buffer is exhausted, small shocks cause big damage.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Reserve Balances** | FRED (WRBWFRBL) | Bank reserves at Fed |
| **ON RRP Facility** | FRED (RRPONTSYD) | MMF cash parked at Fed |
| **EFFR - IORB Spread** | NY Fed | **Leading 1-4 wks** |
| **Reserves vs LCLOR** | Derived | Distance to scarcity |
| **SOFR** | NY Fed | Secured overnight rate |
| **Dealer Net UST Position** | NY Fed | Inventory congestion |

### Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)

```
LCI = 0.25 × z(Reserves_vs_LCLOR)
    + 0.20 × z(-EFFR_IORB_Spread)
    + 0.15 × z(-SOFR_IORB_Spread)
    + 0.15 × z(RRP_Balance)
    + 0.10 × z(-GCF_TPR_Spread)
    + 0.10 × z(-Dealer_Net_Position)
    + 0.05 × z(-EUR_USD_Basis)
```

### Interpretation

| **LCI Range** | **Regime** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Abundant | Flush system, tailwind |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Ample | Normal functioning |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Tight | **Vigilance required** |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Scarce | **Stress emerging** |
| < -1.0 | Crisis | Intervention likely |

### Key Thresholds

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|
| **RRP** | <$200B | Buffer exhausted |
| **Reserves vs LCLOR** | <$300B | Approaching scarcity |
| **EFFR-IORB** | >+8 bps | Acute funding stress |
| **SOFR-IORB** | >+10 bps | Repo market stress |

### Liquidity Transmission Framework (7 Stages)

```
Stage 1: RRP Depletion
Stage 2: Reserve Drainage
Stage 3: SRF Usage Surge
Stage 4: Collateral Stress
Stage 5: Stablecoin Flow Stalls
Stage 6: Perp Basis Collapse
Stage 7: Crypto Liquidations
```

## ENGINE 3: MARKET STRUCTURE (Pillars 11-12)

### The Mechanism of Price Discovery

Market structure isn't a supporting diagnostic—it's **the verdict**. It's where all 10 fundamental pillars get priced. Structure either confirms or diverges from fundamentals, and that divergence is alpha.

```
Trend Integrity → Momentum Confirmation → Breadth Participation →
Sentiment Positioning → Price Discovery →
Trend Integrity (Reinforcing Loop)
```

---

## PILLAR 11: MARKET STRUCTURE — The Verdict

### The Market Structure Transmission Chain

Market structure isn't just price action. It's the mathematical verdict on whether risk is being rewarded.

```
Trend Integrity → Momentum Confirmation → Breadth Participation →
Relative Strength → Price Discovery →
Trend Integrity (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Trend, momentum, and breadth either confirm or diverge. When generals advance without soldiers (price up, breadth down), the rally is living on borrowed time. Structure breakdown precedes fundamental confirmation by 2-4 months.

### Why Market Structure Matters

Structure is the market's ruling on all 10 fundamental pillars. It's where capital flows meet price discovery.

**The Cascade:**

- **Structure → Confirmation:** Strong structure confirms fundamental thesis
- **Structure → Warning:** Weak structure despite strong fundamentals = distribution
- **Structure → Leading:** Structure often breaks before fundamentals deteriorate

### Primary Indicators

#### A. Trend Components

**The Timeframe Stack:** 20d → 50d → 200d. Each tells you something different:
- **20d (1 month):** Immediate momentum, entry timing, early warning
- **50d (1 quarter):** Intermediate trend, primary trading timeframe
- **200d (1 year):** Primary trend, bull/bear regime

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Price vs 200d MA (%)** | Derived | Daily | Primary trend filter |
| **Price vs 50d MA (%)** | Derived | Daily | Intermediate trend filter |
| **Price vs 20d MA (%)** | Derived | Daily | Short-term trend / entry timing |
| **20d MA Slope** | Derived | Daily | Immediate momentum direction |
| **50d MA Slope** | Derived | Daily | Trend acceleration |
| **20d vs 50d Spread (%)** | Derived | Daily | Short-term momentum vs trend |
| **50d vs 200d Spread (%)** | Derived | Daily | Golden/Death cross proximity |

#### B. Momentum Components

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Z-RoC (63d)** | Derived | Daily | Z-scored rate of change |
| **RSI (14d)** | Derived | Daily | Overbought/oversold |

#### C. Breadth Components

**The Breadth Timeframe Stack:** Like trend, breadth operates across multiple timeframes:
- **20d Breadth:** Immediate participation, thrust detection, early warning
- **50d Breadth:** Primary participation gauge, regime classification
- **200d Breadth:** Trend health, secular participation

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **% Stocks > 20d MA** | Bloomberg/Derived | Daily | Short-term participation (thrust detection) |
| **% Stocks > 50d MA** | Bloomberg/Derived | Daily | Participation gauge (primary) |
| **% Stocks > 200d MA** | Bloomberg/Derived | Daily | Trend health |
| **% Stocks at 20d Highs** | Derived | Daily | Immediate momentum breadth |
| **Net New Highs - Lows (20d Avg)** | NYSE | Daily | Expansion/contraction |
| **A/D Line Slope (20d)** | NYSE | Daily | Short-term breadth momentum |
| **A/D Line Slope (50d)** | NYSE | Daily | Intermediate breadth momentum |
| **McClellan Summation Index** | Derived | Daily | Breadth thrust detection |

#### D. Relative Strength

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Asset/SPX Ratio vs 63d MA** | Derived | Daily | Relative trend |
| **Asset/SPX Ratio vs 252d MA** | Derived | Daily | Long-term relative |

### Market Structure Index (MSI)

```
MSI = 0.15 × z(Price_vs_200d_MA_%)
    + 0.10 × z(Price_vs_50d_MA_%)
    + 0.10 × z(50d_MA_Slope)
    + 0.10 × z(20d_MA_Slope)
    + 0.12 × z(Z_RoC_63d)
    + 0.10 × z(%_Stocks_>_50d_MA)
    + 0.08 × z(%_Stocks_>_20d_MA)
    + 0.08 × z(%_Stocks_>_200d_MA)
    + 0.07 × z(Net_New_Highs_Lows_20d_Avg)
    + 0.05 × z(AD_Line_50d_Slope)
    + 0.05 × z(McClellan_Summation)
```

### Interpretation

| **MSI Range** | **Regime** | **Structural Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Strong Uptrend | Full trend-follow exposure | Structure confirming |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Bullish | Normal risk-on | Healthy participation |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Transitional | Reduced exposure | Mixed signals |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Weak | Defensive tilt | Structure deteriorating |
| < -1.0 | Bearish | No trend-follow longs | Structure broken |

### Key Thresholds

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|
| **Price vs 200d** | <0% | Below trend (Rule #1) |
| **Price vs 50d** | <0% | Below intermediate trend |
| **Price vs 20d** | <0% | Below short-term trend |
| **50d vs 200d** | Negative cross | Death cross active (Rule #2) |
| **20d vs 50d** | Negative cross | Short-term rollover warning |
| **20d Slope** | Negative while 50d rising | Early momentum warning |
| **% > 20d MA** | <25% | Short-term washed (bounce setup) |
| **% > 20d MA** | >80% | Short-term crowded |
| **% > 20d MA** | 30% → 70% in 10 days | Breadth thrust (powerful bullish) |
| **% > 50d MA** | <35% | Breadth washed |
| **% > 50d MA** | >85% | Breadth crowded |
| **Net NH-NL** | <-300 (3+ days) | Oversold bounce setup |
| **Net NH-NL** | >+300 (5+ days) | Breadth thrust (bullish) |
| **Z-RoC** | <-1.0 | Momentum broken (Rule #4) |

### Structure-Breadth Divergence (SBD)

```
SBD = z(Price_vs_200d) - z(%_Stocks_>_50d_MA)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **SBD > +1.0:** Price up, breadth lagging → Distribution warning (generals without soldiers)
- **SBD ~ 0:** Price and breadth aligned → Healthy confirmation
- **SBD < -1.0:** Price down, breadth improving → Accumulation setup

**The 20d Thrust Signal:** When % stocks > 20d MA surges from below 30% to above 70% within 10 trading days, it signals a breadth thrust. One of the most reliable indicators of a new bull leg. Rare (2-3 per year) but powerful.

## PILLAR 12: SENTIMENT & POSITIONING — The Crowd

### The Sentiment Transmission Chain

Sentiment isn't noise—it's the crowd's positioning expressed through surveys, options, and flows.

```
Fear → Underexposure → Forced Buying →
Price Rise → Confidence → Overexposure →
Complacency → Forced Selling → Fear (Cycle)
```

**The Insight:** Sentiment is a contrarian indicator. Extreme fear = buy. Extreme greed = sell. The crowd is a source of liquidity, not information. We trade against them at extremes.

### Why Sentiment Matters

Sentiment captures positioning asymmetry. When everyone is already long, who's left to buy? When everyone is already out, who's left to sell?

**The Contrarian Logic:**
- **High Fear:** Underexposed → marginal buyers available → bullish
- **High Greed:** Overexposed → only sellers remain → bearish

### Primary Indicators

#### A. Retail Sentiment

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AAII Bull-Bear Spread** | AAII | Weekly | Retail positioning proxy |
| **Investor Intelligence Bull/Bear** | II | Weekly | Newsletter sentiment |
| **CNN Fear & Greed Index** | CNN | Daily | Composite retail gauge |

#### B. Professional Positioning

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NAAIM Exposure Index** | NAAIM | Weekly | Active manager positioning |
| **COT Net Speculative Position** | CFTC | Weekly | Futures positioning |
| **Hedge Fund Beta** | Prime Broker Data | Weekly | Gross/net exposure |

#### C. Options Positioning

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Equity Put/Call Ratio (10d)** | CBOE | Daily | Hedging demand |
| **VIX Level** | CBOE | Daily | Implied fear |
| **VIX vs 50d MA** | Derived | Daily | Fear relative to recent |
| **VIX Term Structure** | CBOE | Daily | Contango (calm) vs Backwardation (stress) |

#### D. Fund Flows

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ETF Equity Flows (20d)** | ICI/Bloomberg | Weekly | Retail flow proxy |
| **Mutual Fund Flows** | ICI | Monthly | Institutional flow |
| **Money Market Fund Assets** | ICI | Weekly | Cash on sidelines |

### Sentiment & Positioning Index (SPI)

**Convention:** High SPI = contrarian bullish (fear, light positioning, outflows)

```
SPI = 0.20 × z(Put_Call_Ratio_10d)
    + 0.15 × z(VIX_vs_50d_MA)
    + 0.15 × z(-AAII_Bull_Bear)           # Inverted
    + 0.15 × z(-NAAIM_Exposure)           # Inverted
    + 0.10 × z(-Investor_Intelligence)    # Inverted
    + 0.10 × z(-ETF_Equity_Flows_20d)     # Inverted (outflows = bullish)
    + 0.10 × z(VIX_Term_Backwardation)    # Backwardation = stress = bullish
    + 0.05 × z(Money_Market_Assets_YoY)   # Cash on sidelines
```

### Interpretation

| **SPI Range** | **Regime** | **Contrarian Signal** | **Implication** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | Extreme Fear | Strong buy zone | Capitulation, wash-out |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Fear | Buy zone | Underexposed crowd |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated Fear | Favorable entry | Light positioning |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | No contrarian edge | Balanced |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Optimistic | Elevated risk | Crowded longs |
| < -1.0 | Euphoria | Contrarian sell zone | Complacency peak |

### Key Thresholds

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|
| **AAII Bull-Bear** | >+30% | Euphoria (sell) |
| **AAII Bull-Bear** | <-20% | Capitulation (buy) |
| **NAAIM Exposure** | >100% | Fully invested (sell) |
| **NAAIM Exposure** | <50% | Underexposed (buy) |
| **Put/Call (10d)** | >1.1 | Fear elevated (buy) |
| **Put/Call (10d)** | <0.7 | Complacency (sell) |
| **VIX** | >30 | Fear spike (buy) |
| **VIX** | <15 | Complacency (sell) |
| **VIX Term Structure** | Backwardation | Acute stress |

### Sentiment-Structure Divergence (SSD)

```
SSD = z(SPI) + z(MSI)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **SSD > +1.5:** Fear + weak structure → Capitulation low forming
- **SSD ~ 0:** Sentiment and structure aligned
- **SSD < -1.5:** Euphoria + strong structure → Blow-off top risk

## The Three-Engine Analytical Framework

Every trade must pass through the integrated three-engine framework. Single-engine signals are insufficient; we require **convergence across engines** for high-conviction positioning.

### Engine 1: Macro Dynamics (Pillars 1-7)

**Focus:** Labor, Prices, Growth, Housing, Consumer, Business, Trade

**Key Insight:** Flows precede stocks. Labor market deterioration shows up in quits rate and hires/quits ratio 6-9 months before unemployment rises.

**The Cascade:**
```
Labor → Income → Spending → Profits
```

### Engine 2: Monetary Mechanics (Pillars 8-10)

**Focus:** Government (Fiscal), Financial (Credit/Conditions), Plumbing (Liquidity)

**Key Insight:** RRP exhaustion removes the system's shock absorber. Treasury issuance drains reserves directly. **Fiscal Dominance**—the regime where fiscal policy overwhelms monetary policy.

**The Transmission Chain:**
```
Fiscal Deficit → Treasury Issuance → Reserve Drain →
Dealer Congestion → Repo Stress → Credit Tightening →
Risk Asset Repricing
```

### Engine 3: Market Structure (Pillars 11-12)

**Focus:** Structure (Trend, Breadth, Momentum), Sentiment (Positioning, Flows, Surveys)

**Key Insight:** Structure is the verdict. Sentiment is the contrarian edge. When structure confirms fundamentals with washed sentiment, you have maximum conviction. When structure diverges with euphoric sentiment, you have maximum caution.

**The Verdict Chain:**
```
Fundamentals (Engines 1-2) → Price Discovery (Engine 3) →
Confirmation or Divergence → Alpha Signal
```

### Engine Convergence Matrix

| **Engine 1** | **Engine 2** | **Engine 3** | **Signal** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bullish | Supportive | Confirming + Washed | **Maximum Conviction Long** | Full position |
| Bullish | Supportive | Confirming + Neutral | **High Conviction Long** | Normal position |
| Bullish | Supportive | Diverging | **Caution** | Reduce exposure |
| Bullish | Restrictive | Any | **Wait** | No new longs |
| Bearish | Any | Confirming | **Maximum Conviction Short/Defensive** | Full defensive |
| Bearish | Supportive | Diverging + Fear | **Tactical Long Only** | Exhaustion trades |
| Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | **No Edge** | Stay flat or minimal |

---

## Absolute Rules: State-Conditioned Framework

The absolute rules are not removed—they are reconfigured as **conditional absolutes based on recent state**. This keeps discipline while aligning with how trends actually mature. No discretion added—**state detection added**.

### Rule 1: No Trend-Follow Longs Below 200d MA (Conditional)

**Hard Block:** Do not initiate trend-follow positions below 200d MA when the break is **recent** and **downward momentum is expanding**.

**State Detection Criteria:**

| **Condition** | **Definition** | **Detection** |
|---|---|---|
| **Recent Break** | <20 trading days since first 200d violation | Count bars since Price crossed below 200d |
| **Momentum Expanding** | Z-RoC consistently < -1.0 | Z-RoC < -1.0 for 5+ consecutive days |
| **50d Accelerating Down** | 50d MA slope negative and steepening | 50d MA declining faster than prior 10 days |
| **Breadth Deteriorating** | % stocks > 50d MA falling | <35% and declining |

**If ALL conditions present:** Absolute block on trend-follow longs. No exceptions.

**If conditions degrading:** Tactical Exhaustion Trades permitted (see below).

### Rule 2: No Longs with Death Cross Active (Conditional)

**Hard Block:** Do not initiate longs when 50d < 200d **and** the cross is recent with expanding volatility.

**State Detection:**
- Death cross occurred <30 trading days ago
- Volatility (ATR 14d) expanding vs 20d average
- Z-RoC < -0.5

**If mature death cross (>60 days, volatility compressing):** Tactical trades permitted.

### Rule 3: No Longs in Red Relative Panel (Unconditional)

**Hard Block:** Never initiate longs when relative strength panel is red/magenta. This rule has no conditional override—relative underperformance is disqualifying.

### Rule 4: Exit on Z-RoC < -1.0 (Conditional)

**Exit Signal:** Z-RoC < -1.0 triggers exit review.

**State Detection:**
- If Z-RoC < -1.0 with expanding volatility: **Immediate exit**
- If Z-RoC < -1.0 with compressing volatility and price stabilizing: **Reduce, hold tactical portion**

### Rule 5: No Entry >15% Extended from 50d MA (Unconditional)

**Hard Block:** Never chase. This rule has no conditional override.

---

## Trend Maturity and Fatigue

This framework defines two distinct bearish states. The distinction matters because early downtrends are information (new trends, early breaks), while mature downtrends are inventory (forced sales, exhaustion).

### Early/Active Downtrend

**Characteristics:**
- Recent 200d break (<20 trading days)
- 50d MA accelerating downward
- Z-RoC consistently < -1.0
- Breadth declining and fading
- Volatility expanding on down moves

**Trading Response:** No longs. No exceptions. This is information—the market is telling you something. Respect it.

### Mature/Exhausted Downtrend

**Characteristics:**
- Extended time below 200d (>60 trading days)
- Downward momentum slowing (Z-RoC moving from -2.0 toward -0.5)
- Breadth has faded—selling pressure exhausted
- Volatility no longer expanding on bad news
- Price stabilizing or basing

**Trading Response:** Tactical Exhaustion Trades permitted. Core positioning unchanged until trend and relative strength restore.

### Detection Checklist

| **State** | **Time Below 200d** | **Z-RoC Trend** | **Volatility** | **Response** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Early/Active | <20 days | Consistently < -1.0 | Expanding | No longs |
| Transition | 20-60 days | Mixed signals | Stabilizing | Reduced exposure only |
| Mature/Exhausted | >60 days | Rising toward 0 | Compressing | Tactical trades allowed |

---

## Tactical Exhaustion Trades

A clearly labeled, constrained trade class for inventory-driven bounces in mature downtrends. These are **not** system positions—they are short-term reflexive trades.

### Hard Constraints

| **Constraint** | **Limit** |
|---|---|
| **Maximum Positions** | 1-2 concurrent |
| **Maximum Book Exposure** | 3% per position, 5% total |
| **Coexistence** | Cannot coexist with core position additions |
| **Holding Period** | Days to 2 weeks maximum |
| **Profit Harvest** | Take profits quickly—do not trail like trends |
| **Stop** | Tight price stop (5%), no thesis stop |

### Explicit Non-Properties

Tactical Exhaustion Trades are:
- **NOT** positional (no trend-follow intention)
- **NOT** scalable (cannot add to winners)
- **NOT** representative of system views
- **NOT** allowed to convert to core positions without full technical restoration

### Entry Criteria

All must be met:
1. Price below 200d MA for >60 trading days
2. Z-RoC > -1.0 and rising (momentum decelerating)
3. Volatility compressing (ATR 14d < ATR 20d average)
4. Price stabilizing near support or showing divergence
5. No new lows in last 10 trading days
6. **SPI > +1.0** (fear elevated—contrarian edge)

### Positioning Note Template

For any tactical exhaustion trade, include this statement:

> Short-term tactical exhaustion trades may occur, but portfolio positioning will not change until trend and relative strength are restored.

This prevents confusion between reflexive bounces and regime changes.

## Position Sizing & Conviction Framework

### The Regime-Conviction-Size Formula

```
Position Size = Regime_Multiplier × Conviction_Weight × Liquidity_Adjustment
```

**Components:**

1. **Regime Multiplier** (0.0x to 1.2x): Set by MRI
2. **Conviction Weight** (0% to 20%): Set by Conviction Tier
3. **Liquidity Adjustment** (0.5x to 1.0x): Asset-specific

### Conviction Scoring System

**Total Possible: 19 points**
- Technical Score: 0-9 pts
- Fundamental Score: 0-5 pts
- Microstructure Score: 0-5 pts

#### Technical Score Components (0-9 pts)

**1. Primary Trend (0-2 pts)**
- Price > 50d > 200d, both MAs rising: **2 pts**
- Price > 50d > 200d, MAs flat/declining: **1 pt**
- Price > 50d BUT 50d < 200d: **0.5 pts**
- Price < 50d: **0 pts** (disqualified)

**2. Momentum Quality — Context Aware (0-2 pts)**

*In Uptrend (Price > 50d > 200d):*
- Z-RoC > +1.0: **2 pts** (strong momentum)
- Z-RoC 0 to +1.0: **1 pt** (building)
- Z-RoC -1.0 to 0: **0 pts** (acceptable at support)
- Z-RoC < -1.0: **-2 pts** (breakdown, override to exit)

**Critical Insight:** Overbought in uptrend = STRENGTH. Overbought in downtrend = EXHAUSTION.

**3. Structure Confluence (0-1 pt)**
- Price at rising 50d MA (support): **+1 pt**
- Price at resistance: **-1 pt**
- Price in no-man's-land: **0 pts**

**4. Extension Filter (0-1 pt)**
- -8% to -12% from 50d MA (pullback entry): **+1 pt**
- ±3% (near MA): **+0.5 pts**
- 0% to +8%: **0 pts**
- >+15%: **Do not enter**

**5. Relative Strength (0-1 pt)**
- Green panel (relative uptrend): **+1 pt**
- Gray panel (transitional): **0 pts**
- Red/Magenta panel: **Disqualified**

**6. Perfect Setup Bonus (0-2 pts)**
- 5-6 elements: **+2 pts**
- 3-4 elements: **+1 pt**
- <3 elements: **0 pts**

### Conviction Tiers

| **Tier** | **Score Range** | **Conviction Weight** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | 16-19 pts | 20% | Perfect or near-perfect setup |
| Tier 2 | 12-15 pts | 12% | Strong setup, one pillar weaker |
| Tier 3 | 8-11 pts | 7% | Marginal setup, mixed signals |
| Tier 4 | <8 pts | 0% | Insufficient conviction, avoid |

## The Perfect Setup: The 6-Element Configuration

**The only configuration that justifies maximum position sizing.**

### Element 1: Primary Trend Structure
- Price > 50d MA
- 50d MA > 200d MA
- **Both MAs rising** (not just aligned, but ascending)

### Element 2: Relative Trend Alignment
- Asset outperforming benchmark (Panel 2 = Green)
- Relative price > Relative 63d MA > Relative 252d MA

### Element 3: Consolidation Pattern
- **Sideways price action** for 10-30 days after prior uptrend leg
- **Volatility compression** (ATR declining)
- Price oscillating around rising 50d MA but not breaking below
- Volume declining during consolidation

### Element 4: Momentum Behavior During Consolidation
- Z-RoC was strong (+1.0 to +2.0) leading into consolidation
- Z-RoC cooled to -0.5 to +0.5 during consolidation
- **Key:** Momentum dissipated but didn't collapse (never hit -1.0)
- **Interpretation:** Buyers took a breather. Sellers didn't show up.

### Element 5: Breakout Trigger
- Price breaks above consolidation range
- Z-RoC crosses back above 0 (momentum resuming)
- Ideally bouncing off or near rising 50d MA
- Volume expansion on breakout

### Element 6: Macro Regime Confirmation
- MRI not in Crisis territory (<+1.5)
- LCI not critically scarce (>-1.0)
- MSI positive (>0) — structure confirming
- SPI neutral to elevated (>-0.5) — not euphoric
- No acute funding stress signals

### Visual Recognition

```
Price Action (Top Panel):
  Rising blue 200d MA (steady upward slope)
  Rising red 50d MA (steeper slope than 200d)
  Price consolidating horizontally around 50d MA for 2-3 weeks
  Then: Price breaks up, 50d continues rising

Relative Strength (Middle Panel):
  Filled GREEN throughout
  Relative price oscillating but staying above both relative MAs

Z-RoC Momentum (Bottom Panel):
  Came from +1.5 range (prior leg up)
  Cooled to +0.2 during consolidation (buyers rested)
  Never dropped below -0.5 (sellers didn't take control)
  Now turning back up through 0 (momentum resuming)
```

**This is the only setup we truly load up on.**

# SECTION 5: OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK

## Data Infrastructure: `lighthouse_mega`

**Philosophy:** The Iceberg. Local-first Python package handling ETL, curation, and indicator computation. Users see clean signals; complexity is hidden.

### Pipeline Architecture

```
RAW DATA (FRED, Yahoo, Crypto APIs)
         ↓
STAGING (Initial ETL, validation)
         ↓
CURATED PANELS (Time-series standardization)
         ↓
FEATURE ENGINEERING (Lags, changes, z-scores)
         ↓
INDICATOR COMPUTATION (compute_all_indicators)
         ↓
FINAL OUTPUTS (Dashboards, charts, reports)
```

### Key Modules

| **Module** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|
| `data_ingestion/` | FRED, Yahoo, crypto API wrappers |
| `indicators/` | LFI, LCI, MRI, MSI, SPI, all 43 indicators |
| `dashboards/` | Automated chart generation |
| `backtest/` | Historical signal testing |
| `reports/` | Beacon, Chartbook generation |

### Data Orchestration: `daily_flows.py`

**Schedule:**
- **06:00 ET:** Automated data refresh (FRED, JOLTS, Treasury, crypto)
- **07:00 ET:** Indicator computation (all 43 indicators updated)
- **07:15 ET:** Alert generation (threshold breaches, regime changes)

**Critical:** Never fabricate data. If data is missing, flag it. If calculation fails, investigate. Code-first = reproducibility first.

# SECTION 6: COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES

## Voice & Tone: The 80/20/0 Rule

**The Mix:**
- **80% Institutional Rigor:** CFA/CMT credibility, quantitative precision, clear analysis
- **20% Personality:** Dry observations, skepticism of consensus, occasional wit when natural
- **0% Forced Flair:** No manufactured catchphrases, no trying to coin new expressions

**The Key Principle:** Personality should emerge from the analysis, not be layered on top. A sharp observation lands harder than a forced quip. Let the data do the heavy lifting.

**The "We" Frame:** When discussing analysis, data, indicators, or views, speak as Lighthouse Macro. Use "we" and "our" framing. "We're seeing stress in funding markets" not "The data shows stress." "Our LFI is elevated" not "The LFI indicates."

### What Good Looks Like

- "The labor data softened. Again." (Dry, lets the repetition speak)
- "Spreads are pricing one story. Labor is telling another." (Clean contrast)
- "The buffer is gone. The runway is short." (Direct, no embellishment)

### What to Avoid

- Forced metaphors that feel like they're reaching for a catchphrase
- Trying to make every observation "quotable"
- Excessive nautical references beyond the natural brand vocabulary
- Any phrase that sounds like it's auditioning for a newsletter subtitle
- Emdashes. Avoid them. Use commas, periods, or colons instead.
- Any patterns commonly associated with AI-generated content

### Banned Phrases & Patterns

**NEVER use these:**

| **Banned** | **Why** | **Alternative** |
|---|---|---|
| "Cautiously optimistic" | Meaningless hedge | "Conditions improving but fragile" |
| "Geopolitical uncertainty" | Lazy filler | Specify: "Tariff escalation risk" |
| "Complex constellation of factors" | Bureaucratic mush | "Multiple headwinds converging" |
| "In our view" | Unnecessary qualifier | Just state it directly |
| "Going forward" | Pointless filler | Omit or "Looking ahead" |
| "At the end of the day" | Cliche | Omit |
| "It is what it is" | Resignation | Be specific |
| Robotic transitions | AI-sounding | Natural flow |
| Over-excited adjectives | Sensationalism | Measured precision |
| Emdashes (—) | AI pattern | Use commas, periods, colons |

### Standard Sign-Offs

**For formal weekly content (Beacon, Horizon) only:**
> That's our view from the Watch. Until next time, we'll be sure to keep the light on....

**Note:** Don't use this in every communication. It loses impact through overuse.

**For revenue-focused posts (campaigns, product launches):**
Omit the standard sign-off to maintain professional distance.

## Visual Standards: The Nautical 8-Color Palette

### The System

| # | Name | Hex | Phenomena | Usage |
|---|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| 1 | **Ocean** | `#0089D1` | Deep water | Primary data, stable trends, borders |
| 2 | **Dusk** | `#FF6723` | Horizon glow | Warnings, thresholds, accent bar |
| 3 | **Sky** | `#00D4FF` | Clear atmosphere | Volatility, momentum, high energy |
| 4 | **Venus** | `#FF2389` | Belt of Venus (pink twilight) | Critical alerts, extreme readings |
| 5 | **Sea** | `#00BB99` | Calm waters | Secondary series, stable metrics |
| 6 | **Doldrums** | `#D3D6D9` | Becalmed conditions | Backgrounds, grids, reference lines |
| 7 | **Starboard** | `#00FF00` | Green nav light | Extreme bullish, overbought |
| 8 | **Port** | `#FF0000` | Red nav light | Crisis zones, recession |

### Semantic Usage for Charts

**Ocean** — Your default. Main data series, chart borders, primary trends.

**Dusk** — "Pay attention." Warning levels, secondary data needing monitoring.

**Sky** — "High volatility." VIX, realized vol, momentum shifts, rapid changes.

**Venus** — "Act now." Critical stress zones, immediate alerts, system breaking points.

**Sea** — "Complementary." Secondary series that aren't critical but add context.

**Doldrums** — "Quiet reference." Background elements, grids (when needed), subtle guides.

**Starboard** — "Extreme bullish." Overbought conditions, euphoric readings.

**Port** — "Extreme bearish." Recession zones, crisis signals.

### Charting Philosophy

**Standards:**
- **No gridlines** (clean aesthetic)
- **Clean spines** (minimal ink)
- **Right-axis primary** (data on right)
- **Annotate inflections, not noise** (signal over clutter)

**Chart Borders:**
```
Border: 2px solid #0089D1 (Ocean)
Border-radius: 0px (sharp corners)
```

**Chart Captions:**
```

Color: #333333 (Dark Gray)
Format: "Figure [N]: [Description]"

Spacing:

- Caption to next element: 16px
```

**Watermarks:**
```
Top-left: "LIGHTHOUSE MACRO"
Bottom-right: "MACRO, ILLUMINATED."

Styling:
- Font: Montserrat Bold
- Color: Ocean #0089D1 at 15-20% opacity
- Size: 8-10pt (subtle but legible)
```

# SECTION 7: BRAND SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## When to Use the Brand System

**Always apply LHM branding for:**
- Beacon (long-form analysis)
- Beam (single-chart insights)
- Chartbook (50-75 chart compilation)
- Horizon (monthly forward outlook)
- Framework documents (12 Pillars, Trading Strategy, etc.)
- Client presentations
- One-pagers
- Any document representing Lighthouse Macro externally

**Brand consistency = institutional credibility.**

## Quick Reference

When creating any LHM deliverable:

1. **Apply Ocean borders:** All charts get `2px solid #0089D1`
2. **Add captions:** "Figure N: Description" below each chart
3. **Include watermarks:** "LIGHTHOUSE MACRO" (top-left), "MACRO, ILLUMINATED." (bottom-right)
4. **Use Montserrat for headers, Inter for body**
5. **Add contact block in footer**
6. **Include standard sign-off** (for content, not revenue posts)

# APPENDIX: DATA PHILOSOPHY

## Granularity Over Headlines

We almost never want a single series on a chart. We want what's happening under the surface - how A and B are interacting. Decompose, don't summarize. Show the components, the flows, the relationships.

## Flows > Stocks

Analyze rates of change (Quits, Hires) over static levels (Unemployment Rate). Flows lead; stocks lag.

## The Najcky Pipeline

We're building infrastructure that makes Najcky's life easier. He handles backend execution. We handle the hard part upstream: macro data → cleaned → organized → transformed → modeled → outputted → repeatable. He gets clean signals, not raw noise. We shoulder the cost and the data engineering so the analysis is turnkey.

## Code-First = Reproducibility First

Never fabricate data. If data is missing, flag it. If calculation fails, investigate. Python-driven frameworks ensure every signal can be reproduced.
