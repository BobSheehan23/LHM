# PILLAR 11: MARKET STRUCTURE

## The Market Structure Transmission Chain

Market structure isn't just price action. It's the mathematical verdict on whether risk is being rewarded. Structure is where all 10 fundamental pillars get priced—it's the market's ruling on labor, liquidity, credit, and everything else.

```
Trend Integrity → Momentum Confirmation → Breadth Participation →
Relative Strength → Price Discovery →
Trend Integrity (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Trend, momentum, and breadth either confirm or diverge. When generals advance without soldiers (price up, breadth down), the rally is living on borrowed time. Structure breakdown precedes fundamental confirmation by 2-4 months.

The beauty of structure data: it can't be spun. Price is price. Breadth is breadth. Either 70% of stocks are above their 50-day MA or they're not. You can massage GDP with inventory builds. You can engineer earnings with buybacks. But you can't fake breadth. The market votes with its capital, and the ballots are already counted.

---

## Why Market Structure Matters

Market structure is the **final arbiter** in the 12-pillar framework for a simple reason: it's where capital flows meet price discovery. The fundamentals tell you *what should happen*. Structure tells you *what is happening*.

**The Cascade:**

**1. Structure → Confirmation:** Strong structure confirms fundamental thesis (follow the signal)
**2. Structure → Warning:** Weak structure despite strong fundamentals = distribution (be cautious)
**3. Structure → Leading:** Structure often breaks before fundamentals deteriorate (2-4 month lead)
**4. Structure → Positioning:** Structure determines whether to be aggressive or defensive
**5. Structure → Timing:** Entry/exit timing depends on trend and momentum state

Get the structure call right, and you've triangulated when to act. Miss it, and you're trading ideas instead of reality.

**The Divergence Edge:** When structure diverges from fundamentals, one of them is wrong. Structure is usually right earlier. When breadth collapses while price holds (SBD > +1.0), the generals are advancing without soldiers—distribution is underway. When breadth improves while price languishes (SBD < -1.0), accumulation is underway.

## Primary Indicators: The Complete Architecture

### A. TREND COMPONENTS (The Foundation)

Trend is the primary filter. Everything else is subordinate to trend. If price is below the 200-day MA, you're fighting the tape.

**The Timeframe Stack:** 20d → 50d → 200d. Each tells you something different:
- **20d (1 month):** Immediate momentum, entry timing, early warning
- **50d (1 quarter):** Intermediate trend, primary trading timeframe
- **200d (1 year):** Primary trend, bull/bear regime

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Price vs 200d MA (%)** | Derived | Daily | Primary trend filter (+/- = above/below) |
| **Price vs 50d MA (%)** | Derived | Daily | Intermediate trend filter |
| **Price vs 20d MA (%)** | Derived | Daily | Short-term trend / entry timing |
| **20d MA Slope** | Derived | Daily | Immediate momentum direction |
| **50d MA Slope** | Derived | Daily | Trend acceleration (positive = rising) |
| **200d MA Slope** | Derived | Daily | Primary trend direction |
| **20d vs 50d Spread (%)** | Derived | Daily | Short-term momentum vs trend |
| **50d vs 200d Spread (%)** | Derived | Daily | Golden/Death cross proximity |
| **Days Since 200d Cross** | Derived | Daily | Trend maturity gauge |

#### Derived Trend Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Full Trend Stack** | Price > 20d > 50d > 200d | All true | Maximum bullish alignment |
| **Trend Alignment** | Price > 50d > 200d | All true | Standard bullish alignment |
| **Golden Cross** | 50d crosses above 200d | Cross event | Bullish regime shift |
| **Death Cross** | 50d crosses below 200d | Cross event | Bearish regime shift |
| **20d Rollover** | 20d slope turns negative while 50d rising | Diverging | Early warning, momentum stalling |
| **Trend Extension** | (Price - 50d) / 50d × 100 | >15% | Overextended, avoid entry |
| **Trend Maturity** | Days since 200d cross | >60 days | Mature trend (different rules) |

#### Regime Thresholds: Trend

| **State** | **Price vs 200d** | **50d vs 200d** | **MA Slopes** | **Regime** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Strong Uptrend** | >+5% | Positive spread | Both rising | Full risk-on |
| **Uptrend** | >0% | Positive spread | 50d rising | Normal long exposure |
| **Transitional** | Near 200d | Converging | Mixed | Reduced exposure |
| **Downtrend** | <0% | Negative spread | 50d falling | Defensive only |
| **Strong Downtrend** | <-10% | Wide negative | Both falling | No longs |

**The 200d Kill Line:** Below the 200d MA with recent break (<20 days) and expanding momentum, no trend-follow longs. Period. The data doesn't care about your fundamental thesis.

### B. MOMENTUM COMPONENTS (The Confirmation)

Momentum confirms whether trend moves are sustainable or exhausted. Z-scored rate of change (Z-RoC) is the primary metric—it normalizes momentum relative to recent history.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Z-RoC (63d)** | Derived | Daily | Z-scored rate of change (primary) |
| **Z-RoC (21d)** | Derived | Daily | Short-term momentum |
| **RSI (14d)** | Derived | Daily | Relative Strength Index |
| **MACD** | Derived | Daily | Trend momentum oscillator |
| **MACD Histogram** | Derived | Daily | Momentum acceleration |
| **Rate of Change (63d)** | Derived | Daily | Raw momentum (for z-scoring) |

#### Derived Momentum Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Z-RoC Strong** | Z-RoC > +1.0 | In uptrend | Strong momentum, add exposure |
| **Z-RoC Weak** | Z-RoC < -1.0 | Any state | Momentum broken, exit/reduce |
| **Z-RoC Divergence** | Price new high, Z-RoC lower high | Diverging | Momentum warning |
| **RSI Overbought** | RSI > 70 | In uptrend | Strength (not sell signal) |
| **RSI Oversold** | RSI < 30 | In downtrend | Exhaustion possible |

#### Regime Thresholds: Momentum

| **Z-RoC Range** | **In Uptrend** | **In Downtrend** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +2.0 | Extremely strong | Exhaustion bounce | Trail stops / Tactical only |
| +1.0 to +2.0 | Strong momentum | Relief rally | Add exposure / No core longs |
| 0 to +1.0 | Building | Decelerating down | Normal / Reduced |
| -1.0 to 0 | Acceptable pullback | Resuming down | Hold / Exit |
| < -1.0 | **Exit trigger** | Confirming breakdown | Exit / Avoid |

**Critical Insight:** Overbought in uptrend = STRENGTH. Overbought in downtrend = EXHAUSTION. Context matters.

### C. BREADTH COMPONENTS (The Participation)

Breadth tells you whether the market is healthy or hollow. A rising index with narrowing breadth is a market on borrowed time.

**The Breadth Timeframe Stack:** Like trend, breadth operates across multiple timeframes:
- **20d Breadth:** Immediate participation, thrust detection, early warning
- **50d Breadth:** Primary participation gauge, regime classification
- **200d Breadth:** Trend health, secular participation

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **% Stocks > 20d MA** | Bloomberg/Derived | Daily | Short-term participation (thrust detection) |
| **% Stocks > 50d MA** | Bloomberg/Derived | Daily | Participation gauge (primary) |
| **% Stocks > 200d MA** | Bloomberg/Derived | Daily | Trend health |
| **% Stocks at 20d Highs** | Derived | Daily | Immediate momentum breadth |
| **% Stocks at 20d Lows** | Derived | Daily | Immediate weakness breadth |
| **Net New Highs - Lows (52w)** | NYSE | Daily | Expansion/contraction |
| **Net NH-NL (20d Avg)** | NYSE | Daily | Smoothed NH-NL |
| **20d High-Low Differential** | Derived | Daily | % at 20d highs minus % at 20d lows |
| **Advance-Decline Line** | NYSE | Daily | Cumulative participation |
| **A/D Line Slope (20d)** | NYSE | Daily | Short-term breadth momentum |
| **A/D Line Slope (50d)** | NYSE | Daily | Intermediate breadth momentum |
| **McClellan Oscillator** | Derived | Daily | Breadth thrust detection |
| **McClellan Summation Index** | Derived | Daily | Cumulative breadth thrust |

#### Derived Breadth Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **20d Breadth Thrust** | % > 20d MA rises from <30% to >70% in 10 days | Cross event | Powerful trend initiation |
| **20d Breadth Washed** | % > 20d MA < 25% | Below threshold | Short-term oversold |
| **20d Breadth Crowded** | % > 20d MA > 85% | Above threshold | Short-term overbought |
| **50d Breadth Washed** | % > 50d MA < 35% | Below threshold | Oversold, contrarian buy |
| **50d Breadth Crowded** | % > 50d MA > 85% | Above threshold | Overbought, reduce exposure |
| **Breadth Thrust (52w)** | NH-NL > +300 for 5+ days | Sustained | Strong bullish signal |
| **Breadth Collapse (52w)** | NH-NL < -300 for 3+ days | Sustained | Oversold bounce setup |
| **20d Momentum Thrust** | % at 20d highs > 40% | Above threshold | Broad momentum surge |
| **20d Momentum Collapse** | % at 20d lows > 40% | Above threshold | Broad capitulation |
| **A/D Divergence** | Price up, A/D line down | Diverging | Distribution warning |
| **Breadth Confirmation** | 20d, 50d, 200d breadth all improving | Aligned | Full participation |

#### Regime Thresholds: 20d Breadth

| **% Stocks > 20d MA** | **Regime** | **Conditional Forward Returns** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 25% | Washed | Next 20d: +2.1% avg, 68% win | Short-term bounce likely |
| 25-40% | Weak | Below average | Cautious, watch for thrust |
| 40-60% | Neutral | Normal returns | Standard exposure |
| 60-80% | Strong | Above average | Momentum intact |
| > 80% | Crowded | Next 20d: +0.3% avg, 52% win | Short-term caution |

#### Regime Thresholds: 50d Breadth

| **% Stocks > 50d MA** | **Regime** | **Conditional Forward Returns** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 30% | Washed | Next 63d: +4.8% avg, 71% win | Look for tactical longs |
| 30-50% | Weak | Below average | Cautious |
| 50-70% | Healthy | Normal returns | Standard exposure |
| 70-85% | Strong | Slightly below avg | Normal, monitor |
| > 85% | Crowded | Next 63d: +1.2% avg, 55% win | Reduce, don't chase |

**The Breadth Truth:** When % stocks > 50d MA collapses below 35%, selling is exhausted. When it exceeds 85%, buying is exhausted. Trade against the crowd at extremes.

**The 20d Thrust Signal:** When % stocks > 20d MA surges from below 30% to above 70% within 10 trading days, it signals a breadth thrust—one of the most reliable indicators of a new bull leg. These thrusts are rare (2-3 per year) but powerful.

### D. RELATIVE STRENGTH (The Selection)

Relative strength determines *what* to buy, not just *when* to buy. Never buy a laggard in hopes of mean reversion.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Asset/SPX Ratio** | Derived | Daily | Relative performance |
| **Ratio vs 63d MA** | Derived | Daily | Short-term relative trend |
| **Ratio vs 252d MA** | Derived | Daily | Long-term relative trend |
| **Relative Slope (50d)** | Derived | Daily | Relative momentum |
| **Sector Relative Strength** | Derived | Daily | Sector leadership rotation |

#### Relative Strength Panel Colors

| **State** | **Condition** | **Panel Color** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strong Outperformance** | Ratio > 63d > 252d, all rising | Green | Full position allowed |
| **Outperformance** | Ratio > 63d > 252d | Green | Normal position |
| **Transitional** | Ratio crossing MAs | Gray | Reduced position |
| **Underperformance** | Ratio < 63d < 252d | Red/Magenta | **No longs (Absolute Rule #3)** |

**The Relative Rule:** Never initiate longs in red relative panel. No exceptions. Relative underperformance is disqualifying regardless of absolute trend.

## Market Structure Index (MSI)

The MSI synthesizes trend, momentum, breadth, and relative strength into a single composite across multiple timeframes.

### Formula

```
MSI = 0.15 × z(Price_vs_200d_MA_%)
    + 0.10 × z(Price_vs_50d_MA_%)
    + 0.10 × z(50d_MA_Slope)
    + 0.10 × z(20d_MA_Slope)
    + 0.12 × z(Z_RoC_63d)
    + 0.10 × z(%_Stocks_>_50d_MA)
    + 0.08 × z(%_Stocks_>_20d_MA)
    + 0.08 × z(%_Stocks_>_200d_MA)
    + 0.07 × z(Net_New_Highs_Lows_20d_Avg)
    + 0.05 × z(AD_Line_50d_Slope)
    + 0.05 × z(McClellan_Summation)
```

### Weight Rationale

| **Component** | **Weight** | **Rationale** |
|---|---|---|
| Price vs 200d | 0.15 | Primary trend filter |
| Price vs 50d | 0.10 | Intermediate trend position |
| 50d Slope | 0.10 | Trend acceleration |
| 20d Slope | 0.10 | Immediate momentum direction |
| Z-RoC | 0.12 | Momentum confirmation |
| % > 50d MA | 0.10 | Primary breadth gauge |
| % > 20d MA | 0.08 | Short-term participation (thrust detection) |
| % > 200d MA | 0.08 | Trend health |
| Net NH-NL (20d) | 0.07 | Leadership expansion |
| A/D Slope | 0.05 | Cumulative participation |
| McClellan Sum | 0.05 | Breadth thrust detection |

### MSI Interpretation

| **MSI Range** | **Regime** | **Structural Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Strong Uptrend | Full trend-follow exposure | Structure confirming |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Bullish | Normal risk-on | Healthy participation |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Transitional | Reduced exposure | Mixed signals |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Weak | Defensive tilt | Structure deteriorating |
| < -1.0 | Bearish | No trend-follow longs | Structure broken |

---

## Structure-Breadth Divergence (SBD)

SBD measures the gap between price strength and participation. It's the "generals vs soldiers" indicator.

### Formula

```
SBD = z(Price_vs_200d) - z(%_Stocks_>_50d_MA)
```

### Interpretation

| **SBD Range** | **State** | **Interpretation** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | Extreme Distribution | Price elevated, breadth collapsed | High alert, reduce |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | Distribution | Generals advancing, soldiers lagging | Caution, trail stops |
| -0.5 to +1.0 | Aligned | Price and breadth in sync | Normal positioning |
| -1.5 to -0.5 | Accumulation | Price weak, breadth improving | Watch for turn |
| < -1.5 | Extreme Accumulation | Capitulation, breadth diverging up | Contrarian buy zone |

**The SBD Signal:** When SBD > +1.0, the market is hollow—a small number of stocks carrying the index. When SBD < -1.0, the market is healthy under the surface despite weak headlines.

Pillar 11 directly enforces the Absolute Trading Rules:

| **Rule** | **MSI/Structure Check** | **Enforcement** |
|---|---|---|
| Rule #1: Below 200d | Price vs 200d < 0% | No trend-follow longs |
| Rule #2: Death Cross | 50d < 200d | No longs (conditional) |
| Rule #3: Red Relative | Relative panel red | No longs (unconditional) |
| Rule #4: Z-RoC < -1.0 | Momentum broken | Exit trigger |
| Rule #5: >15% Extended | Price vs 50d > +15% | No entry |

## Trading Applications

### When MSI Confirms Fundamentals (Engines 1-2)

- **Both positive:** Maximum conviction, full position sizing
- **Fundamentals positive, MSI weakening:** Reduce exposure, trail stops
- **Fundamentals positive, MSI negative:** No new longs, wait for structure

### When MSI Diverges from Fundamentals

- **Fundamentals weak, MSI strong:** Structure likely wrong—follow fundamentals
- **Fundamentals strong, MSI weak:** Distribution underway—respect structure
- **Fundamentals neutral, MSI extreme:** Follow structure as tiebreaker

### Using SBD for Timing

- **SBD > +1.0 with MSI positive:** Late-stage rally, tighten stops
- **SBD < -1.0 with MSI negative:** Washout in progress, prepare for entry
- **SBD normalizing from extremes:** Trend continuation likely

*That's how we read the structure from the Watch. The market doesn't lie—it just speaks in breadth and momentum.*
