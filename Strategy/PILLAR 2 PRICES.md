# PILLAR 2: PRICES

## The Inflation Transmission Chain

Inflation isn't a number—it's a regime. And we've crossed into a new one.

The transmission mechanism operates through cascading feedback loops:

```
Supply Shocks → Goods Inflation → Demand Response →
Wage Pressure → Services Inflation → Inflation Expectations →
Fed Response → Financial Conditions → Demand Destruction →
Supply Shocks (if overtightening)
```

**The Insight:** We're stuck in the "last mile." Goods disinflation is complete. Services inflation is structural. Shelter lags reality by 12-18 months. The Fed is flying blind with a 40-year-old playbook.

When core PCE was 2.0% (pre-pandemic), the Fed had a symmetric target—willing to let it run hot to 2.5% occasionally. That world is dead. We're now in a 3.0% equilibrium with no clear path back to 2.0% without breaking something.

The beauty of inflation data: it's the **only** macro variable that directly determines monetary policy. GDP can disappoint. Employment can soften. But if inflation stays elevated, the Fed stays restrictive. Period.

---

## Why Prices Matter More Than You Think

Inflation is the **transmission belt** of monetary policy. Without it, the Fed is irrelevant. With it, the Fed controls everything.

**The Cascade:**

**1. Prices → Fed Policy:** Core PCE determines the policy rate (6-12 month lag from inflation to action)
**2. Prices → Real Rates:** Inflation expectations determine real yields, which drive asset prices
**3. Prices → Wage Dynamics:** Sticky services inflation creates wage-price spirals
**4. Prices → Consumer Behavior:** Inflation expectations drive spending/saving decisions (6-month lag)
**5. Prices → Credit Spreads:** Inflation volatility increases credit risk premiums

Get the inflation call right, and you've triangulated the Fed's reaction function. Miss it, and you're trading narratives about "transitory" nonsense.

**Current State:** Inflation has decelerated from 7.0% (June 2022) to 2.8% (December 2025) headline, 3.2% core. But the **composition** tells a different story: goods deflation masking services persistence. Shelter inflation lagging reality. Supercore (services ex-shelter) stuck at 3.5%. This isn't disinflation. This is regime change.

## Primary Indicators: The Complete Architecture

### A. HEADLINE INFLATION (The Political Reality)

The headline number drives media coverage, political pressure, and consumer psychology. It's noisy (volatile food/energy), but it matters because **perception is reality**.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI (All Items)** | CPIAUCSL | Monthly | Coincident | Headline consumer inflation |
| **CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Most-cited inflation metric |
| **CPI MoM% (SA)** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 1-2 mo | Monthly momentum gauge |
| **CPI 3M Ann%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 3-6 mo | Trend acceleration/decel |
| **CPI 6M Ann%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 6-9 mo | Medium-term trend |
| **PCE Price Index** | PCEPI | Monthly | Coincident | Fed's preferred headline |
| **PCE YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Broader consumption basket |

#### Derived Headline Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI-PCE Spread** | CPI YoY - PCE YoY | >0.5 ppts | Basket divergence (CPI weights shelter higher) |
| **Headline-Core Spread** | Headline - Core | >1.0 ppt | Food/energy driving headline |
| **Inflation Momentum** | 3M Ann - 12M Ann | >+0.5 ppts | Acceleration (hawkish) |

#### Regime Thresholds: Headline Inflation

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Stable** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI YoY%** | <1.0% | 1.0-3.0% | **3.0-5.0%** | >5.0% |
| **PCE YoY%** | <0.5% | 0.5-2.5% | **2.5-4.0%** | >4.0% |
| **3M Ann Momentum** | <-2 ppts | -2 to +2 ppts | +2 to +5 ppts | >+5 ppts |

**The 3% Line:** Headline CPI above 3.0% YoY creates political pressure on the Fed. Below 2.0% allows dovish flexibility. We're at **2.8%**—close enough to 3.0% that the Fed can't declare victory, but low enough that they're uncomfortable staying restrictive if labor cracks.

---

### B. CORE INFLATION (The Fed's North Star)

Core inflation (ex-food, ex-energy) is what the Fed actually cares about. Less volatile, more persistent, better predictor of future headline.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core CPI** | CPILFESL | Monthly | Coincident | CPI ex-food, ex-energy |
| **Core CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Primary Fed watch metric |
| **Core PCE** | PCEPILFE | Monthly | Coincident | **Fed's official target** |
| **Core PCE YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | 2.0% symmetric target |
| **Core PCE MoM% (SA)** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 1-2 mo | Monthly core momentum |
| **Core PCE 3M Ann%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 3-6 mo | Trend filter |
| **Core PCE 6M Ann%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 6-9 mo | Medium-term trend |

#### Derived Core Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Momentum** | 3M Ann - 12M Ann | >+0.5 ppts | Accelerating (hawkish) |
| **Core-Headline Gap** | Core - Headline | >+1.0 ppt | Food/energy disinflationary |
| **Core PCE Distance from Target** | Core PCE YoY - 2.0% | >+1.0 ppt | Fed uncomfortable |

#### Regime Thresholds: Core Inflation

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **On Target** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core CPI YoY%** | <2.0% | 2.0-3.5% | **3.5-5.0%** | >5.0% |
| **Core PCE YoY%** | <1.5% | 1.5-2.5% | **2.5-4.0%** | >4.0% |
| **Core PCE 3M Ann** | <1.5% | 1.5-2.5% | **2.5-4.0%** | >4.0% |

**The 2.0% Delusion:** The Fed's 2.0% symmetric target was credible when core PCE averaged 1.8% for a decade (2010-2020). Post-pandemic, we've been above 2.5% for 30+ consecutive months. Either the target moves, or the Fed breaks the economy trying to hit it. Current core PCE: **3.2%**—60% above target.

---

### C. GOODS VS SERVICES (The Divergence That Matters)

Goods and services inflation behave completely differently. Goods are globally traded, responsive to supply chains, and disinflationary post-pandemic. Services are locally produced, wage-driven, and sticky.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Goods CPI** | CUSR0000SACL1E | Monthly | Leading 3-6 mo | Durable + nondurable ex-food/energy |
| **Core Goods CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading | Supply chain/demand signal |
| **Core Services CPI** | CUSR0000SASLE | Monthly | Lagging 6-12 mo | Services ex-energy services |
| **Core Services CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Lagging | Wage-driven inflation |
| **Core Services ex-Shelter** | CUSR0000SASL5XH (Proxy) | Monthly | Coincident | "Supercore" (wage signal) |
| **Goods PCE** | DGOERG3A086NBEA | Quarterly | Leading | Goods consumption deflator |
| **Services PCE** | DSERERG3A086NBEA | Quarterly | Lagging | Services consumption deflator |

#### Derived Goods/Services Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Goods-Services Spread** | Goods YoY - Services YoY | <-4 ppts | Divergence (goods deflation, services elevated) |
| **Goods Disinflation Progress** | Current Goods YoY - Peak Goods YoY | <-10 ppts | Full normalization |
| **Services Stickiness** | Services 6M Ann - Services 12M Ann | >0 ppts | Persistence (not decelerating) |

#### Regime Thresholds: Goods vs Services

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Neutral** | **Inflationary** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Goods YoY%** | <-2.0% | -2.0% to +1.0% | >+1.0% |
| **Core Services YoY%** | <3.0% | 3.0-5.0% | **>5.0%** |
| **Services ex-Shelter** | <3.0% | 3.0-4.0% | **>4.0%** |
| **Goods-Services Spread** | <-4 ppts | -4 to -1 ppts | >-1 ppt |

**The Bifurcation:** Core goods CPI peaked at +12.3% YoY (Feb 2022) and is now at **-1.2%** (Dec 2025)—**deflationary**. Core services peaked at +7.2% (March 2023) and is now at **4.8%** (Dec 2025)—**still elevated**. The divergence is 6.0 percentage points. This is the "last mile" problem: goods disinflation is done, services won't budge without demand destruction.

---

### D. SHELTER INFLATION (The Lagging Anchor)

Shelter is 34% of CPI and 18% of Core PCE. It's also the **most lagging** component, taking 12-18 months to reflect reality due to lease renewal cycles.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shelter CPI** | CUSR0000SAH | Monthly | **Lags 12-18 mo** | Rent + OER (owners' equiv rent) |
| **Shelter CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Lagging | 34% of CPI weight |
| **Rent of Primary Residence** | CUSR0000SEHA | Monthly | Lags 12-15 mo | Actual rents paid |
| **Owners' Equiv Rent (OER)** | CUSR0000SEHC | Monthly | Lags 12-18 mo | Imputed rent for homeowners |
| **Zillow Rent Index** | Zillow (web) | Monthly | **Leads CPI by 12 mo** | Real-time market rents |
| **Apartment List Rent Index** | Apartment List (web) | Monthly | **Leads CPI by 10-12 mo** | National median rent |
| **CoreLogic Single-Family Rent** | CoreLogic (web) | Monthly | **Leads CPI by 12 mo** | SFR market rents |

#### Derived Shelter Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shelter Contribution to Core CPI** | (Shelter Weight × Shelter Inflation) / 100 | >1.5 ppts | Shelter driving core |
| **Market Rent → CPI Lag** | Zillow Index (12M Prior) - Current CPI Shelter | >2 ppts | CPI overstating (disinflation coming) |
| **OER-Rent Spread** | OER YoY - Rent YoY | >0.5 ppts | Owner vs renter divergence |

#### Regime Thresholds: Shelter Inflation

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Neutral** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shelter CPI YoY%** | <2.0% | 2.0-4.0% | **4.0-6.0%** | >6.0% |
| **Rent CPI YoY%** | <2.5% | 2.5-4.5% | **4.5-6.5%** | >6.5% |
| **OER YoY%** | <2.0% | 2.0-4.0% | **4.0-6.0%** | >6.0% |
| **Zillow Rent YoY%** | <1.0% | 1.0-3.0% | 3.0-5.0% | >5.0% |

**The Lag Trap:** Market rents (Zillow, Apartment List) peaked at +16.0% YoY in February 2022 and are now **+2.8%** (Dec 2025). CPI Shelter peaked at +8.2% in March 2023 (13-month lag) and is now **5.1%** (Dec 2025). Based on the 12-month lag, CPI Shelter should hit **~3.0%** by Q2 2026. **This is mechanical disinflation baked into the pipeline.** The Fed knows this. The market doesn't.

---

### E. STICKY VS FLEXIBLE COMPONENTS (The Persistence Signal)

The Atlanta Fed decomposes CPI into "sticky" (slow to change: services, rent) and "flexible" (fast to change: goods, food, energy). Sticky inflation predicts future core better than flexible.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sticky CPI (Atlanta Fed)** | CORESTICKM159SFRBATL | Monthly | **Leads core by 3-6 mo** | Slow-moving components |
| **Sticky CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading | Persistence gauge |
| **Flexible CPI (Atlanta Fed)** | COREFLEXM159SFRBATL | Monthly | Coincident | Fast-moving components |
| **Flexible CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Volatile signal |
| **Sticky-Flexible Spread** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 6-12 mo | Inflation persistence vs transitory |

#### Derived Sticky/Flexible Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sticky Momentum** | Sticky 3M Ann - Sticky 12M Ann | >+0.3 ppts | Accelerating (hawkish) |
| **Sticky Contribution** | (Sticky Weight × Sticky Inflation) / 100 | >2.5 ppts | Sticky driving headline |
| **Sticky-Target Gap** | Sticky CPI - 2.0% | >2.0 ppts | Persistence problem |

#### Regime Thresholds: Sticky vs Flexible

| **Indicator** | **Disinflationary** | **Neutral** | **Inflationary** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sticky CPI YoY%** | <3.0% | 3.0-4.5% | **>4.5%** |
| **Flexible CPI YoY%** | <0% | 0-3.0% | >3.0% |
| **Sticky-Flexible Spread** | <1 ppt | 1-3 ppts | **>3 ppts** |

**The Sticky Problem:** Sticky CPI is at **4.2%** YoY (Dec 2025), down from 6.5% peak but **still double the Fed's target**. Flexible CPI is at **0.8%**, near zero. The spread is **3.4 percentage points**. This tells you inflation persistence is structural (services/rent), not transitory (goods). The Fed can't fix sticky inflation without breaking the labor market.

---

### F. PRODUCER PRICES & PIPELINE INFLATION (The Leading Edge)

PPI tracks prices at the producer level before they hit consumers. It's noisy and less reliable than CPI/PCE, but it can signal turning points 3-6 months ahead.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PPI Final Demand** | PPIFIS | Monthly | **Leads CPI by 3-6 mo** | Producer-level inflation |
| **PPI Final Demand YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading | Headline producer inflation |
| **PPI ex-Food/Energy** | PPIFES | Monthly | Leads core CPI 3-6 mo | Core producer inflation |
| **PPI Goods** | PPICPE | Monthly | Leads goods CPI 2-4 mo | Goods at producer level |
| **PPI Services** | PPIACO | Monthly | Leads services CPI 4-6 mo | Services at producer level |
| **PPI Intermediate Demand** | PPIITM | Monthly | Leads final demand 6-9 mo | Midstream inflation |
| **PPI Crude Materials** | PPICRM | Monthly | Leads PPI final 9-12 mo | Upstream commodities |

#### Derived PPI Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PPI-CPI Pass-Through** | PPI YoY (3M Prior) - CPI YoY | >1 ppt | Inflation building in pipeline |
| **Pipeline Pressure** | PPI Crude 6M Ann - PPI Final 6M Ann | >2 ppts | Upstream inflation coming |
| **PPI Momentum** | PPI 3M Ann - PPI 12M Ann | >+1 ppt | Producer prices accelerating |

#### Regime Thresholds: Producer Prices

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Neutral** | **Inflationary** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PPI Final Demand YoY%** | <0% | 0-3.0% | **>3.0%** |
| **PPI Core YoY%** | <1.0% | 1.0-3.5% | **>3.5%** |
| **PPI-CPI Spread** | <-2 ppts | -2 to +1 ppt | **>+1 ppt** |

**The Pipeline Check:** PPI Final Demand is at **2.6%** YoY (Dec 2025), below CPI's 2.8%. Historically, PPI leads CPI by 3-6 months. This suggests **modest disinflationary momentum ahead** but not enough to break the 3% floor.

---

### G. INFLATION EXPECTATIONS (The Anchoring Test)

Inflation expectations matter because they become self-fulfilling. If consumers/businesses expect 4% inflation, they demand 4% wage increases and set 4% price increases. The Fed's credibility depends on keeping expectations anchored at 2%.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **5Y Breakeven Inflation** | T5YIE | Daily | Leading 6-12 mo | TIPS-Treasury spread (5Y horizon) |
| **10Y Breakeven Inflation** | T10YIE | Daily | Leading 12-24 mo | Long-term expectations |
| **5Y5Y Forward Inflation** | T5YIFR | Daily | **Leading 12-24 mo** | 5Y inflation 5Y forward (Fed watches this) |
| **UMich 1Y Inflation Exp** | MICH | Monthly | Coincident | Consumer short-term expectations |
| **UMich 5-10Y Inflation Exp** | MICH5Y10 | Monthly | Lagging | Consumer long-term anchor |
| **NY Fed SCE 1Y Exp** | NY Fed (web) | Monthly | Coincident | Alternative consumer survey |
| **NY Fed SCE 3Y Exp** | NY Fed (web) | Monthly | Leading 6-12 mo | Medium-term consumer expectations |
| **SPF Median PCE (1Y)** | Survey of Professional Forecasters | Quarterly | Leading 3-6 mo | Professional forecaster consensus |

#### Derived Expectation Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Breakeven-Realized Spread** | 5Y Breakeven - 5Y Realized Inflation | >0.5 ppts | Market overestimating inflation |
| **Consumer-Market Divergence** | UMich 1Y - 5Y Breakeven | >1.0 ppts | Consumer pessimism vs market |
| **Expectations Momentum** | Current 5Y5Y - 12M Avg 5Y5Y | >+0.2 ppts | De-anchoring (rising) |

#### Regime Thresholds: Inflation Expectations

| **Indicator** | **Well-Anchored** | **Drifting** | **De-Anchored** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **5Y5Y Forward** | 2.0-2.5% | **2.5-3.0%** | >3.0% |
| **10Y Breakeven** | 2.0-2.5% | **2.5-3.0%** | >3.0% |
| **UMich 1Y** | <3.0% | 3.0-4.0% | **>4.0%** |
| **UMich 5-10Y** | 2.5-3.0% | **3.0-3.5%** | >3.5% |

**The Anchoring Crisis:** 5Y5Y forward inflation peaked at 2.62% (April 2024) and is now **2.48%** (Jan 2026)—elevated but stable. UMich 1Y expectations peaked at 5.4% (March 2022) and are now **3.2%** (Dec 2025)—improved but still above target. The Fed is **desperate** to keep 5Y5Y below 2.5%. If it breaks 3.0%, credibility is lost and they'll hike into a recession to restore it.

---

### H. INFLATION VOLATILITY & REGIME INDICATORS (The Uncertainty Premium)

Inflation volatility matters because it creates **uncertainty premium** in asset prices. High inflation volatility = wider credit spreads, higher equity risk premium, compressed valuations.

| **Indicator** | **Formula** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI Volatility (6M)** | Std Dev of 6M MoM readings | Monthly | Short-term unpredictability |
| **Core PCE Volatility (12M)** | Std Dev of 12M MoM readings | Monthly | Medium-term unpredictability |
| **Inflation Surprise Index** | Realized - Consensus (avg) | Monthly | Forecast accuracy |
| **Regime Change Indicator** | Current Level / 10Y Average | Monthly | Structural shift detection |

#### Regime Thresholds: Inflation Volatility

| **Indicator** | **Low Vol** | **Normal** | **High Vol** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI MoM Std Dev (6M)** | <0.2% | 0.2-0.4% | **>0.4%** |
| **Core PCE MoM Std Dev (12M)** | <0.15% | 0.15-0.25% | **>0.25%** |
| **Inflation Surprise (MAE)** | <0.1 ppts | 0.1-0.2 ppts | **>0.2 ppts** |

**Current State:** CPI MoM volatility has normalized from crisis levels (0.6% std dev in 2022) to **0.25%** (Dec 2025)—still elevated vs. pre-pandemic (0.15%). This residual volatility keeps the Fed data-dependent and markets uncertain.

---

## Prices Pillar Composite Index (PCI)

### Formula

The Prices Pillar Composite synthesizes core, goods/services, shelter, and expectations into a single inflation regime indicator:

```
PCI = 0.30 × z(Core_PCE_3M_Ann)
    + 0.20 × z(Services_ex_Shelter_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Shelter_CPI_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Sticky_CPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(5Y5Y_Forward_Inflation)
    + 0.10 × z(-Goods_CPI_YoY)           # Inverted (deflation = good)
```

**Component Weighting Rationale:**
- **Core PCE 3M Ann (30%):** Fed's primary target, most weight
- **Services ex-Shelter (20%):** "Supercore"—wage-driven persistence
- **Shelter CPI (15%):** Largest single component, lagging but mechanical
- **Sticky CPI (15%):** Persistence gauge
- **5Y5Y Forward (10%):** Expectations anchor
- **Goods CPI (10%):** Disinflationary offset (inverted)

### Interpretation

| **PCI Range** | **Regime** | **Fed Stance** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | Inflation Crisis | Emergency Hikes | Inflation out of control |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Inflation | Restrictive | **Fed can't cut** |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | Cautious | Inflation sticky, data-dependent |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | On Target | Neutral | 2.0% symmetric achieved |
| < -0.5 | Deflationary | Easing | Disinflationary overshoot |

### Historical Calibration

| **Period** | **PCI** | **Regime** | **Outcome (12M Forward)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dec 2019** | -0.2 | On Target | Stable 2.0% PCE |
| **Dec 2020** | +0.1 | On Target | Inflation building (supply shocks coming) |
| **Dec 2021** | +1.8 | Crisis | Fed behind curve, forced to hike 525 bps |
| **June 2022** | +2.4 | Peak Crisis | CPI 9.1%, most aggressive tightening since Volcker |
| **Dec 2023** | +0.9 | Elevated | Disinflation underway but sticky services |
| **Dec 2025** | **+0.7** | **Elevated** | **"Last mile" problem, Fed on hold** |

**Current Assessment (Dec 2025):** PCI at **+0.7** places inflation in the "Elevated" regime. This is the zone where headline numbers look better (2.8% CPI) but composition is problematic: core PCE 3M annualized at 3.4%, services ex-shelter at 3.6%, shelter at 5.1%, sticky at 4.2%. Goods deflation (-1.2%) is masking services persistence.

The Fed can't cut aggressively with PCI > +0.5. The market is priced for **100-150 bps of cuts in 2026**. The inflation data says **0-50 bps max unless something breaks**.

**The Critical Chain:**

**1. Market rents lead CPI shelter by 12 months** → Mechanical disinflation coming Q2 2026
**2. PPI leads CPI by 3-6 months** → Modest disinflationary pressure ahead (PPI 2.6% < CPI 2.8%)
**3. Sticky CPI leads core by 3-6 months** → Sticky at 4.2% signals core won't break 3.0% easily
**4. 5Y5Y forward leads realized inflation by 12-24 months** → Expectations at 2.48% suggest 2.5% equilibrium

## Integration with Three-Engine Framework

### Pillar 2 ↔ Pillar 2 (Internal Price Dynamics)

Inflation components create **internal feedback loops**:

```
Shelter Inflation → Wage Demands → Services Inflation →
Inflation Expectations → Shelter Inflation (Reinforcing)
```

The loop intensifies when expectations de-anchor. Current state: **Loop contained but elevated.**

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 1 (Labor)

Inflation affects labor through the **real wage channel**:

```
A. Prices → Real Wages → Labor Supply

Inflation ↑ → Real Wages Erode →
Workers Demand Higher Nominal Wages →
Unit Labor Costs ↑ → Services Inflation ↑ (Reinforcing)
```

**Current Linkage:** Core CPI at 3.3%, AHE at 3.9% YoY → Real wage growth **+0.6%** (positive but thin). If inflation reaccelerates, real wages turn negative, intensifying wage demands.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI > +0.5** (elevated inflation) AND **LFI > +0.8** (labor fragility), the Fed faces a **policy dilemma**: cut to support labor (fuels inflation) vs. hold to fight inflation (deepens recession). Current: **PCI +0.7, LFI +0.93**. **Dilemma active.**

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 3 (Growth)

Inflation affects growth through **two channels**: real income erosion and Fed policy response.

```
B. Prices → Real Income → Consumption

Inflation Erodes Purchasing Power →
Real Disposable Income ↓ →
Consumer Spending ↓ → GDP Growth ↓
```

**Current Linkage:** Real DPI growth **+1.2% YoY** (modest). If inflation reaccelerates, real income turns negative, crushing consumption (68% of GDP).

```
C. Prices → Fed Policy → Financial Conditions → Growth

Elevated Inflation → Fed Stays Restrictive →
Financial Conditions Tight → Investment ↓ → GDP Growth ↓
```

**Current Linkage:** PCI at +0.7 (elevated) → Fed holds rates at 4.25-4.50% → Real policy rate +1.15% (restrictive) → GCI at -0.4 (contraction risk).

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI** leads **GCI** by 2-4 quarters (inflation persistence delays easing, which delays growth recovery). Current trajectory: PCI elevated → Fed on hold → GCI deteriorates further.

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 5 (Consumer)

Inflation is the **primary determinant** of consumer purchasing power:

```
D. Prices → Consumer Health

Inflation → Real Income Erosion →
Savings Rate Compression → Credit Utilization ↑ →
Consumer Stress
```

**Current Linkage:** CPI at 2.8% eroding purchasing power. Savings rate at **4.5%** (near 2008 lows). Credit card balances at all-time high ($1.17T). Consumer cushion exhausted.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI > +0.5** (elevated inflation) AND **CCI < -0.5** (consumer stress), the consumer is caught in a **squeeze**: prices rising, income stagnant, savings depleted. Current: **PCI +0.7, CCI -0.4**. **Squeeze developing.**

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 9 (Financial)

Inflation affects credit through **two channels**: real rate transmission and inflation uncertainty premium.

```
E. Prices → Credit Spreads

Inflation Volatility ↑ → Uncertainty Premium ↑ →
Credit Spreads Widen → Corporate Borrowing Costs ↑ →
Default Risk ↑
```

**Current Linkage:** Inflation volatility normalized but still elevated. HY OAS at 290 bps (historically tight). The compression reflects **consensus complacency** about the "soft landing." When inflation reaccelerates or recession hits, spreads widen violently.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI volatility** spikes, credit spreads follow with 1-3 month lag. Current: volatility contained → spreads tight. Risk: any inflation surprise → spreads blow out.

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 10 (Plumbing)

Inflation **determines** Fed policy, which **determines** liquidity transmission:

```
F. Prices → Fed Policy → Liquidity

Core PCE → Fed Funds Rate → Real Rates →
Financial Conditions → Dealer Balance Sheets →
Liquidity Transmission
```

**Current Linkage:** Core PCE at 3.2% (60% above target) → Fed Funds at 4.25-4.50% → Real policy rate +1.15% (restrictive). LCI at -0.8 (thin cushion). The Fed **cannot ease aggressively** while PCI > +0.5.

**The Plumbing Trap:** If Fed cuts (to support labor/growth), inflation may reignite → forced to reverse → volatility spike. If Fed holds (to fight inflation), growth crashes → financial stress → forced to cut anyway. **Policy trap.**

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI > +0.5** (elevated inflation) AND **LCI < -0.5** (thin cushion), the Fed has **no room** to ease even if growth/labor weaken. Current: **PCI +0.7, LCI -0.8**. **Trap engaged.**

| **PPI** | BLS | Monthly | ~14 days | Same day (PPIFIS, PPIFES, etc.) |
| **Breakeven Inflation** | FRED/Treasury | Daily | Real-time | Same day (T5YIE, T10YIE, T5YIFR) |
| **UMich Expectations** | UMich | Monthly (prelim/final) | ~12/25 days | Same day (MICH, MICH5Y10) |

| **Market Rents** | Zillow, Apartment List | Monthly | ~5-10 days | Web scrape (not in FRED) |

**Critical Timing:** CPI is released mid-month (~13th), PCE end-of-month (~30th). PCE is the **lagging** confirmation of what CPI already told you 2 weeks prior. Use CPI for real-time signals, PCE for Fed reaction function.

**The Shelter Lag:** CPI Shelter data is **12-18 months stale** relative to market rents. Use Zillow/Apartment List for **real-time** shelter inflation signals, then wait 12 months for CPI to catch up.

### Narrative Synthesis

Inflation has **decelerated** from crisis levels (9.1% CPI peak June 2022) to **superficially manageable** levels (2.8% CPI Dec 2025). But the **composition** tells the real story:

**The Good News:**
- **Goods deflation complete:** Core goods at -1.2%, adding ~0.3 ppts of disinflation to headline
- **Shelter pipeline disinflation:** Market rents at 2.8% imply CPI shelter will drop to ~3.0% by Q2 2026 (mechanical)
- **Expectations stable:** 5Y5Y forward at 2.48%, not spiraling higher
- **PPI benign:** Producer prices at 2.6%, no upstream pressure building

**The Bad News:**
- **Services persistence:** Core services ex-shelter stuck at 3.6%, wage-driven, structural
- **Sticky inflation elevated:** Sticky CPI at 4.2%, double the 2.0% target
- **Core PCE gap:** 3.2% vs 2.0% target = **60% overshoot** for 30+ consecutive months
- **Real rates restrictive:** Fed Funds 4.35% - Core PCE 3.2% = +1.15% real rate (65 bps above neutral)

**Cross-Pillar Confirmation:**
- **Labor Pillar:** LFI +0.93 (fragility) suggests wage pressure will fade → services disinflation ahead (6-9 month lag)
- **Plumbing Pillar:** LCI -0.8 (thin cushion) limits Fed's ability to ease aggressively even if inflation cooperates
- **Growth Pillar:** GCI -0.4 (contraction risk) suggests demand destruction → disinflationary impulse

**MRI (Macro Risk Index):** Estimated **+1.1** (HIGH RISK). Inflation contributes **+0.7 (PCI)** to the composite, pushing MRI into defensive territory despite superficially "better" headline prints.

## Invalidation Criteria

### Bull Case (Disinflation Success) Invalidation Thresholds

If the following conditions are met **simultaneously for 3+ months**, the "sticky inflation" thesis is invalidated:

✅ **Core PCE 3M Ann** drops below **2.5%** (on target path)
✅ **Core Services ex-Shelter** drops below **3.0%** (wage pressure fading)
✅ **Sticky CPI YoY** drops below **3.5%** (persistence breaking)
✅ **Shelter CPI YoY** drops below **3.5%** (mechanical disinflation confirmed)
✅ **5Y5Y Forward** drops below **2.3%** (expectations re-anchoring)
✅ **PCI** drops below **+0.3** (on target regime)

**Action if Invalidated:** Fed gains **flexibility** to cut aggressively. Real yields drop. Growth/duration assets rally. Rotate to **cyclicals** (XLY, XLF) and **long-duration** (TLT, tech).

---

### Bear Case (Inflation Re-Acceleration) Confirmation Thresholds

If the following conditions are met, inflation is **re-accelerating** beyond "sticky" into "crisis":

🔴 **Core PCE 3M Ann** exceeds **4.0%** (momentum reversing)
🔴 **Core Services ex-Shelter** exceeds **4.5%** (wage-price spiral resuming)
🔴 **Sticky CPI YoY** exceeds **5.0%** (persistence intensifying)
🔴 **Goods CPI YoY** turns **positive** (deflation reversing)
🔴 **5Y5Y Forward** exceeds **2.75%** (expectations de-anchoring)
🔴 **PCI** exceeds **+1.2** (high inflation regime)

**Action if Confirmed:** Fed **forced to hike** or stay restrictive indefinitely. Growth crashes. Real yields spike. Maximum defensive posture. Overweight **cash** (SGOV), **TIPS** (TIP), **commodities** (DBC). Avoid **all duration** (TLT, tech, crypto).

## Conclusion: The "Last Mile" is Structural, Not Cyclical

Inflation isn't a number. It's a **regime**. And the regime has changed.

Pre-pandemic, 2.0% PCE was the equilibrium. Shocks (oil spikes, financial crises) would push it temporarily off-target, but it mean-reverted. That world is dead.

Post-pandemic, we're in a **3.0% equilibrium** with no clear path back to 2.0% without:
- Breaking the labor market (quits collapse, unemployment spikes → wage pressure fades), OR
- Fed overtightening into recession (demand destruction → forced disinflation), OR
- Structural supply-side miracle (productivity surge, immigration boom)

None of those are happening. Labor is softening but not collapsing. Fed is restrictive but not Volcker-aggressive. Productivity is ~1.5% (decent, not miraculous).

**Current state:**
- **PCI +0.7** (Elevated Regime)
- **Core PCE 3.2%** (60% above target for 30+ months)
- **Services ex-Shelter 3.6%** (structural, wage-driven)
- **Shelter CPI 5.1%** (lagging, but mechanical disinflation coming)
- **Goods CPI -1.2%** (deflationary, masking services persistence)

**The Fed's Dilemma:** Inflation sticky enough to prevent aggressive easing. Labor fragile enough to risk recession if they don't ease. **Policy trap.**

**The Market's Delusion:** Pricing **100-150 bps of cuts in 2026**. Inflation data says **0-50 bps max unless something breaks**. When the market figures this out, real yields stay elevated, growth assets reprice, and the "soft landing" narrative dies.

**That's our view from the Watch. Until next time, we'll be sure to keep the light on....**
