## Notes

- Content is 90-100% written; this is optimization/publishing, not creation from scratch
- Each pillar post: What it is → Why it matters → How to track it → What it affects
- Use series as opportunity to review/refine framework as you go
- Paid posts keep subscribers engaged with real-time application
- Series ends Feb 28 with readers having full mental model
