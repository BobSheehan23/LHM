## Framework Overview

### The Three-Engine Framework

The 10 Macro Pillars feed into our **Three-Engine Framework**:

1. **Macro Dynamics** (Pillars 1-7): Labor, Prices, Growth, Housing, Consumer, Business, Trade
2. **Monetary Mechanics** (Pillars 8-10): Government, Financial, Plumbing
3. **Market Technicals**: Price action, momentum, sentiment (covered separately)

### The Macro Risk Index (MRI)

The MRI synthesizes all 10 pillars into a single regime indicator:

| **MRI Range** | **Regime** | **Equity Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| < -0.5 | Low Risk | 65-70% | Full expansion, overweight cyclicals |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | 55-60% | Balanced positioning |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | 45-55% | Reduce cyclicals, add defensives |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Risk | 35-45% | Defensive posture |
| > +1.5 | Crisis | 25-35% | Maximum defense, cash/bonds |

**Current MRI (January 2026): +1.1 (HIGH RISK)**

# PILLAR 1: LABOR

## The Labor Transmission Chain

Labor isn't just employment data. It's the economic genome—the code that determines whether the expansion continues or the system resets. The transmission mechanism operates through cascading flows:

```
Worker Confidence → Job-Switching Behavior → Wage Pressure →
Income Growth → Spending Capacity → Corporate Pricing Power →
Profit Margins → Hiring Decisions → Worker Confidence
```

**The Insight:** This isn't a linear chain. It's a feedback loop. And the loop is breaking.

When workers stop quitting, they're not being prudent. They're seeing something management hasn't admitted yet. The quits rate is the economy's truth serum—it strips away the narrative and exposes the underlying fragility. Six to nine months before the unemployment rate rises, quits collapse. Every. Single. Time.

---

## Why Labor Leads Everything

Labor is the **alpha generator** in the framework for a simple reason: it sits upstream of every other economic flow.

**The Cascade:**

**1. Labor → Consumer:** Income determines spending capacity (1-3 month lag)
**2. Labor → Credit:** Employment stress precedes default risk (3-6 month lag)
**3. Labor → Housing:** Job stability drives home-buying decisions (6-9 month lag)
**4. Labor → Growth:** Hours worked contracts before output falls (2-4 month lag)
**5. Labor → Prices:** Wage pressure drives services inflation (persistent)

---

## Labor Fragility Index (LFI)

```
LFI = 0.30 × z(Long_Term_Unemployed_Share)
    + 0.25 × z(-Quits_Rate)                    # Inverted
    + 0.20 × z(-Hires_Quits_Ratio)             # Inverted
    + 0.15 × z(-Temp_Help_YoY)                 # Inverted
    + 0.10 × z(-Job_Hopper_Premium)            # Inverted
```

**Current LFI: +0.93** (Elevated Fragility)

| **LFI Range** | **Regime** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| < 0.0 | Healthy | Labor market robust |
| 0.0 to +0.5 | Neutral | Balanced conditions |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | **Fragility developing** |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High | Pre-recessionary |
| > +1.5 | Critical | Recession imminent |

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quits Rate** | 1.9% | <2.0% = Pre-recessionary | 🔴 **Breach** |
| **Long-Term Unemployed Share** | 25.7% | >22% = Fragility | 🔴 **Breach** |
| **Temp Help YoY%** | -7.1% | <-3% = Recession signal | 🔴 **Breach** |
| **Job-Hopper Premium** | 0.2 ppts | <0.5 ppts = Late-cycle | 🔴 **Breach** |
| **Unemployment Rate** | 4.2% | <4.5% = Stable | 🟢 OK |
| **LPI Estimate** | **-0.6** | <-0.5 = Softening | 🟡 **Softening Regime** |
| **LFI Estimate** | **+0.93** | >+0.5 = Fragility | 🔴 **Elevated** |

**Narrative:** The labor market is exhibiting **classic late-cycle bifurcation**: stocks look fine, flows are deteriorating. Workers have stopped quitting (1.9%, below 2.0% threshold). Long-term unemployment is spiking (25.7%). Temp help is collapsing (-7.1% YoY). The job-hopper premium is gone (0.2 ppts).

---

# PILLAR 2: PRICES

## The Inflation Transmission Chain

Inflation isn't a number—it's a regime. And we've crossed into a new one.

```
Supply Shocks → Goods Inflation → Demand Response →
Wage Pressure → Services Inflation → Inflation Expectations →
Fed Response → Financial Conditions → Demand Destruction →
Supply Shocks (if overtightening)
```

**The Insight:** We're stuck in the "last mile." Goods disinflation is complete. Services inflation is structural. Shelter lags reality by 12-18 months. The Fed is flying blind with a 40-year-old playbook.

---

## Why Prices Matter

Inflation is the **transmission belt** of monetary policy. Without it, the Fed is irrelevant. With it, the Fed controls everything.

**The Cascade:**

**1. Prices → Fed Policy:** Core PCE determines the policy rate
**2. Prices → Real Rates:** Inflation expectations determine real yields
**3. Prices → Wage Dynamics:** Sticky services inflation creates wage-price spirals
**4. Prices → Consumer Behavior:** Inflation expectations drive spending/saving decisions
**5. Prices → Credit Spreads:** Inflation volatility increases credit risk premiums

---

## Primary Indicators

### A. Core Inflation

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core PCE** | PCEPILFE | Monthly | **Fed's official target** |
| **Core CPI** | CPILFESL | Monthly | Primary Fed watch metric |

### B. Goods vs Services

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Goods CPI** | CUSR0000SACL1E | Supply chain/demand signal |
| **Core Services CPI** | CUSR0000SASLE | Wage-driven inflation |
| **Services ex-Shelter** | Derived | "Supercore" (wage signal) |

### C. Shelter Inflation

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shelter CPI** | BLS | **Lags 12-18 mo** | 34% of CPI weight |
| **Zillow Rent Index** | Zillow | **Leads CPI by 12 mo** | Real-time market rents |

### D. Inflation Expectations

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **5Y5Y Forward Inflation** | FRED | **Fed's anchor gauge** |
| **UMich 1Y Expectations** | UMich | Consumer short-term expectations |

---

## Prices Pillar Composite Index (PCI)

```
PCI = 0.30 × z(Core_PCE_3M_Ann)
    + 0.20 × z(Services_ex_Shelter_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Shelter_CPI_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Sticky_CPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(5Y5Y_Forward_Inflation)
    + 0.10 × z(-Goods_CPI_YoY)           # Inverted
```

**Current PCI: +0.7** (Elevated Regime)

| **PCI Range** | **Regime** | **Fed Stance** |
|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | Inflation Crisis | Emergency Hikes |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Inflation | Restrictive |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | **Cautious** |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | On Target | Neutral |
| < -0.5 | Deflationary | Easing |

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core PCE YoY** | 3.2% | 2.0% target | 🔴 **60% above target** |
| **Core Services ex-Shelter** | 3.6% | <4.0% manageable | 🟡 **Sticky** |
| **Shelter CPI YoY** | 5.1% | <4.0% comfortable | 🔴 **Elevated (lagging)** |
| **Goods CPI YoY** | -1.2% | Negative = deflationary | 🟢 Disinflationary |
| **5Y5Y Forward** | 2.48% | 2.0-2.5% anchored | 🟡 **Drifting high** |
| **PCI Estimate** | **+0.7** | <+0.5 on target | 🟡 **Elevated** |

**Narrative:** Inflation has decelerated from crisis (9.1% peak) to elevated (2.8% headline, 3.2% core). But composition tells the real story: goods deflation (-1.2%) masking services persistence (3.6%). Shelter disinflation baked in (market rents 2.8% → CPI shelter ~3.0% by Q2 2026).

---

# PILLAR 3: GROWTH

## The Growth Transmission Chain

Growth isn't GDP. It's the **velocity of economic metabolism**—the speed at which labor, capital, and innovation combine to produce output.

```
Demand Shock → Production Response → Inventory Adjustment →
Capital Investment → Hiring Decisions → Income Growth →
Demand Shock (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Growth is a **second derivative** phenomenon. What matters isn't the level—it's the *change in the rate of change*. When industrial production *decelerates* from +3.5% to +1.2%, that's a **momentum break** that precedes recession by 6-9 months.

---

## Primary Indicators

### A. GDP & Components

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real GDP** | GDPC1 | Lagging 1-2 qtrs | Inflation-adjusted output |
| **GDI-GDP Gap** | Derived | **Leading 2-4 qtrs** | Recession signal |

### B. Industrial Production

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Industrial Production** | INDPRO | **Leads GDP 1-2 qtrs** | Factory output |
| **IP: Manufacturing** | IPMAN | Leads GDP 2-3 qtrs | 75% of IP |
| **Capacity Utilization** | TCU | Coincident | % of capacity in use |

### C. Business Investment

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Capital Goods Orders** | NEWORDER | **Leads capex 4-8 mo** | CEO forward commitment |

---

## Growth Pillar Composite Index (GCI)

```
GCI = 0.25 × z(Industrial_Production_YoY)
    + 0.20 × z(ISM_Manufacturing)
    + 0.15 × z(Core_Capital_Goods_Orders_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Aggregate_Weekly_Hours_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(Real_Retail_Sales_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(Housing_Starts_YoY)
    + 0.05 × z(-GDI_GDP_Spread)
```

**Current GCI: -0.4** (Contraction Risk)

| **GCI Range** | **Regime** | **Equity Allocation** |
|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Strong Expansion | 65-70% |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Moderate Expansion | 60-65% |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral/Stagnation | 55-60% |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Contraction Risk | **45-50%** |
| < -1.0 | Recession | 30-40% |

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real GDP YoY** | +2.5% | <1.0% = stagnation | 🟢 Headline OK |
| **Industrial Production YoY** | -0.8% | <-1% = contraction | 🔴 **Manufacturing recession** |
| **ISM Manufacturing** | 49.3 | <48 = recession | 🟡 **26-month contraction** |
| **Core Capex Orders YoY** | -2.8% | <-5% = severe | 🔴 **CEO pessimism** |
| **Aggregate Hours YoY** | -1.2% | <0% = contraction | 🔴 **Labor input shrinking** |
| **GCI Estimate** | **-0.4** | <-0.5 = contraction | 🟡 **Contraction Risk** |

**Narrative:** Growth exhibiting classic late-cycle: headline GDP stable (+2.5%) but composition deteriorating. Manufacturing in 26-month recession. Business investment contracting. Only services holding up (ISM 54.1).

---

# PILLAR 4: HOUSING

## The Housing Transmission Chain

Housing isn't shelter—it's the **financial system's collateral backbone**.

```
Mortgage Rates → Affordability → Purchase Demand →
Home Prices → Household Wealth → Consumer Spending →
Collateral Values → Credit Availability →
Mortgage Rates (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Housing is a **leveraged bet on rates and demographics**. When mortgage rates spike 400 bps in 18 months, transaction volumes collapse. But prices don't fall proportionally—locked-in sellers refuse to list, creating the "golden handcuffs" phenomenon.

---

## Primary Indicators

### A. Construction

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Building Permits** | PERMIT | **Leads starts 1-2 mo** | Future pipeline |
| **Housing Starts** | HOUST | **Leads GDP 6-9 mo** | New construction |

### B. Sales

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Existing Home Sales** | NAR | Coincident | Market liquidity |
| **New Home Sales** | Census | Leads starts 1-3 mo | Builder forward-looking |

### C. Prices & Affordability

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Case-Shiller HPI** | S&P/CoreLogic | Wealth effect anchor |
| **30Y Mortgage Rate** | Freddie Mac | Affordability constraint |
| **Affordability Index** | NAR | 100 = median income qualifies |

---

## Housing Pillar Composite Index (HCI)

```
HCI = 0.20 × z(Housing_Starts_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Existing_Home_Sales_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(NAHB_Index)
    + 0.15 × z(-Months_Supply)
    + 0.10 × z(HPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(-30Y_Mortgage_Rate)
    + 0.10 × z(MBA_Purchase_Index_YoY)
    + 0.05 × z(-Mortgage_Delinquency)
```

**Current HCI: -0.6** (Contraction)

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Housing Starts YoY%** | -8.2% | <-10% = recession | 🟡 **Weak** |
| **Existing Home Sales** | 3.84M | <4.0M = frozen | 🔴 **30-year low** |
| **Case-Shiller YoY%** | +3.8% | <0% = deflation | 🟢 **Stable** |
| **30Y Mortgage Rate** | 6.95% | >7.0% = frozen | 🟡 Elevated |
| **Affordability Index** | 82 | <90 = crisis | 🔴 **Worst since 1985** |
| **Mortgage Delinquency** | 2.1% | >3.5% = stressed | 🟢 **Healthy** |
| **HCI Estimate** | **-0.6** | <-0.5 = contraction | 🟡 **Housing Contraction** |

**Narrative:** Housing in **frozen equilibrium**—not crashing, not recovering. Transaction volumes at 30-year lows. Affordability at 40-year lows. But prices stable (+3.8% YoY) because supply collapsed alongside demand. No forced selling (delinquency 2.1%, equity $315k median).

---

# PILLAR 5: CONSUMER

## The Consumer Transmission Chain

The consumer isn't a sector—it's **68% of GDP**.

```
Employment Security → Income Growth → Confidence →
Spending Decisions → Credit Usage → Retail Sales →
Corporate Revenue → Hiring Decisions →
Employment Security (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** The consumer is a **lagging indicator pretending to be coincident**. By the time retail sales collapse, labor already cracked 6-9 months prior.

---

## Primary Indicators

### A. Spending Flows

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Real PCE** | PCEC96 | Inflation-adjusted spending |
| **Retail Sales** | RSXFS | Goods-focused spending |

### B. Income & Savings

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Personal Saving Rate** | PSAVERT | Fuel tank gauge |
| **Real DPI** | DSPIC96 | Purchasing power |

### C. Consumer Credit

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Credit Card Delinquency** | Fed | Early stress signal |
| **Credit Card Balances** | NY Fed | Revolving debt |

### D. Confidence

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **CB Consumer Confidence** | Conf Board | Headline sentiment |
| **CB Expectations** | Conf Board | **Leads recession 6-9 mo** |

---

## Consumer Pillar Composite Index (CCI)

```
CCI = 0.25 × z(Real_PCE_YoY)
    + 0.20 × z(Personal_Saving_Rate)
    + 0.15 × z(-Credit_Card_Delinquency)
    + 0.15 × z(CB_Expectations)
    + 0.10 × z(Real_DPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(-Debt_Service_Ratio)
    + 0.05 × z(Card_Spending_YoY)
```

**Current CCI: -0.3** (Fatigued)

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real PCE YoY%** | +2.1% | <1.5% = stagnation | 🟡 Decelerating |
| **Personal Saving Rate** | 4.5% | <5.0% = depleted | 🔴 **Below normal** |
| **Credit Card Delinquency** | 3.0% | >3.5% = stressed | 🟡 **Elevated** |
| **CB Expectations** | 78 | <80 = recession signal | 🔴 **Below threshold** |
| **CCI Estimate** | **-0.3** | <-0.5 = stressed | 🟡 **Consumer Fatigued** |

**Narrative:** Consumer in **Stage 2 of stress sequence**: savings depleted, credit stress building, spending maintained but decelerating. Excess savings (~$2.1T accumulated during COVID) now fully exhausted. Credit card balances at record $1.17T. Delinquencies at 3.0% (highest since 2012).

---

# PILLAR 6: BUSINESS

## The Business Transmission Chain

Business activity isn't just corporate earnings—it's the **forward bet on demand**.

```
CEO Confidence → Capex Plans → Equipment Orders →
Production Schedules → Inventory Decisions →
Hiring Plans → Payroll Expansion →
Consumer Income → Final Demand →
CEO Confidence (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Businesses are **leading indicators** because they commit capital 6-18 months before sales materialize.

---

## Primary Indicators

### A. Small Business Sentiment

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NFIB Optimism** | NFIB | **Leads GDP 3-6 mo** | 44% of GDP, 48% of employment |

### B. Capital Expenditure

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Capital Goods Orders** | NEWORDER | **Leads capex 4-8 mo** | CEO forward commitment |

### C. Surveys

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ISM Manufacturing** | ISM | **Leads IP 2-4 mo** | >50 = expansion |
| **ISM Services** | ISM | Coincident | 80% of economy |

### D. Inventories

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Inventory/Sales Ratio** | ISRATIO | **Leads recession 3-6 mo** |

---

## Business Pillar Composite Index (BCI)

```
BCI = 0.20 × z(NFIB_Optimism)
    + 0.20 × z(Core_Capex_Orders_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(ISM_Manufacturing)
    + 0.15 × z(ISM_Services)

    + 0.05 × z(-HY_Spreads)
```

**Current BCI: -0.4** (Slowing)

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NFIB Optimism** | 89.4 | <90 = recessionary | 🔴 **Lowest since 2012** |
| **Core Capex Orders YoY%** | -2.8% | <-3% = contraction | 🔴 **Contracting** |
| **ISM Manufacturing** | 49.3 | <48 = deep contraction | 🟡 **26-month contraction** |
| **ISM Services** | 54.1 | <52 = weak | 🟢 Still expanding |
| **I/S Ratio** | 1.41 | >1.40 = overstocked | 🟡 **Elevated** |
| **BCI Estimate** | **-0.4** | <-0.5 = contraction | 🟡 **Business Slowing** |

**Narrative:** Business in **late-cycle bifurcation**—small vs large, manufacturing vs services. NFIB at 12-year low. Manufacturing in 26-month recession. But large cap earnings positive (+4% YoY), services expanding (54.1). Divergences close in recessions.

---

# PILLAR 7: TRADE

## The Trade Transmission Chain

Trade isn't imports and exports—it's the **global margin of adjustment**.

```
Dollar Strength → Import Prices → Domestic Inflation →
Export Competitiveness → Manufacturing Output →
Trade Balance → Capital Flows → Dollar Strength (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Trade is the **pressure release valve** for domestic imbalances. When the U.S. runs a $1T trade deficit, it's exporting demand and importing disinflation.

---

## Primary Indicators

### A. Trade Balance

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Trade Balance** | BOPGSTB | Net trade position |
| **Trade Balance / GDP** | Derived | Sustainability metric |

### B. Prices

|---|---|---|---|
| **Import Price Index** | IMP | **Leads CPI goods 3-6 mo** | Tariff pass-through |

### C. Dollar

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **DXY (Dollar Index)** | DTWEXBGS | USD vs major currencies |

### D. Supply Chains

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **NY Fed GSCPI** | NY Fed | Global Supply Chain Pressure |

## Trade Pillar Composite Index (TCI)

```
TCI = 0.20 × z(-Import_Price_YoY)
    + 0.20 × z(-Trade_Balance_GDP_Ratio)
    + 0.15 × z(Export_Volume_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(-NY_Fed_GSCPI)
    + 0.10 × z(Container_Volume_YoY)

    + 0.10 × z(-Trade_Policy_Uncertainty)
```

**Current TCI: -0.5** (Headwind)

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Trade Balance** | -$78B | >-$85B = improving | 🟢 Narrowing |
| **Import Price YoY%** | +3.8% | >+3% = inflationary | 🔴 **Tariff pass-through** |
| **Export Volume YoY%** | -2.1% | <0% = weak | 🔴 **Retaliatory drag** |
| **DXY YoY%** | +7.2% | >+5% = headwind | 🔴 **Strong dollar** |
| **GSCPI** | +0.8 | >+1.0 = stress | 🟡 Elevated |
| **TCI Estimate** | **-0.5** | <-0.5 = headwind | 🟡 **Trade Headwind** |

**Narrative:** Trade in **structural reconfiguration**. Tariff regime at 60-year highs (avg 6.2%). Dollar strength (+7.2% YoY) crushing competitiveness. Import prices +3.8% (tariff pass-through). Decoupling from China real (import share down from 22% to 12.8%).

---

# PILLAR 8: GOVERNMENT

## The Fiscal Transmission Chain

Government isn't just policy—it's **$6.5 trillion in annual spending** and **$35 trillion in outstanding debt**.

```
Fiscal Policy → Deficit Spending → Treasury Issuance →
Interest Rates → Private Investment Crowding →
Growth Impact → Tax Receipts →
Deficit (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** We've entered **Fiscal Dominance**—the regime where fiscal policy overwhelms monetary policy. The Fed can hike all it wants, but if Treasury is issuing $2T+ annually, the supply of duration crushes bond prices regardless.

## Government Pillar Composite Index (GCI-Gov)

```
GCI-Gov = 0.25 × z(Deficit_GDP)
        + 0.20 × z(Interest_Outlays)
        + 0.15 × z(Debt_GDP)
        + 0.15 × z(Term_Premium)

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deficit/GDP** | 7.2% | >5% = elevated | 🔴 **Wartime levels** |
| **Debt/GDP** | 122% | >100% = elevated | 🔴 **Highest since WWII** |
| **Interest/Outlays** | 16% | >15% = crowding | 🔴 **Larger than defense** |
| **Term Premium** | +25 bps | >+50 bps = repricing | 🟡 **Rising, more to go** |
| **GCI-Gov Estimate** | **+1.1** | >+1.0 = high stress | 🔴 **Fiscal Dominance** |

**Narrative:** We've entered **Fiscal Dominance**. $1.9T deficit (7.2% GDP)—wartime levels in peacetime. $1.1T interest (larger than defense). Term premium rising from -50 bps to +25 bps—market finally pricing fiscal risk. But equilibrium is +150 bps. 10Y yields going to 5.5%+ as term premium normalizes.

# PILLAR 9: FINANCIAL

## The Financial Transmission Chain

Financial conditions aren't just rates—they're the **plumbing that connects Fed policy to the real economy**.

```
Fed Policy Rate → Bank Funding Costs → Credit Availability →
Lending Standards → Loan Growth → Business Investment →
Hiring → Income → Spending → Fed Policy Rate (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** The Fed sets the policy rate, but **financial conditions determine whether it matters**. When credit spreads are tight and banks are lending freely, restrictive policy is blunted.

---

## Primary Indicators

### A. Credit Spreads

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **HY OAS** | BAMLH0A0HYM2 | **Leads defaults 6-9 mo** |
| **IG OAS** | BAMLC0A0CM | Leads HY 1-2 mo |

### B. Yield Curve

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **10Y-2Y Spread** | T10Y2Y | **Leads recession 12-18 mo** |
| **10Y-3M Spread** | T10Y3M | Fed's preferred measure |

### C. Financial Conditions

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Chicago Fed NFCI** | Chicago Fed | **Leads GDP 2-4 qtrs** |

### D. Bank Lending

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **SLOOS Tightening** | Fed | **Leads loan growth 2-4 qtrs** |
| **C&I Loan Growth** | Fed H.8 | Credit transmission |

## Financial Pillar Composite Index (FCI)

```
FCI = 0.20 × z(-HY_OAS)
    + 0.15 × z(-NFCI)
    + 0.15 × z(Yield_Curve_10Y2Y)
    + 0.15 × z(-Real_Fed_Funds)
    + 0.10 × z(C&I_Loan_Growth)
    + 0.10 × z(-VIX)
    + 0.10 × z(LCI)
    + 0.05 × z(-SLOOS_Tightening)
```

**Current FCI: +0.3** (Neutral, but divergent)

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HY OAS** | 290 bps | <300 = complacent | 🔴 **3rd percentile—mispriced** |
| **10Y-2Y Spread** | +32 bps | <0 = inverted | 🟢 Dis-inverted |
| **NFCI** | -0.42 | >0 = tight | 🟢 Loose |
| **VIX** | 14.2 | >20 = elevated | 🟢 Complacent |
| **SLOOS Tightening** | +38% | >+20% = tightening | 🔴 **Banks restricting** |
| **LCI** | -0.8 | <-0.5 = scarce | 🔴 **Unbuffered system** |
| **FCI Estimate** | **+0.3** | <-0.5 = tight | 🟡 **Neutral (divergent)** |

**Narrative:** Financial conditions exhibiting **unprecedented divergence**. Markets say "loose" (HY 290 bps, VIX 14). Banks say "tight" (SLOOS +38%, C&I +1.2%). Credit spreads are **100-150 bps too tight** for underlying macro reality.

# PILLAR 10: PLUMBING

## The Liquidity Transmission Chain

Plumbing isn't just Fed policy—it's the **$8 trillion reservoir** that determines whether monetary policy reaches the real economy.

```
Fed Balance Sheet → Reserves → Bank Balance Sheets →
Dealer Intermediation → Repo Markets →
Money Market Rates → Financial Conditions →
Asset Prices → Real Economy
```

**The Insight:** Liquidity transmits **mechanically**: RRP → Reserves → Dealer Balance Sheets → Repo → Risk Assets. When the RRP buffer is exhausted (it is), small shocks cause big damage.

---

## Primary Indicators

### A. Fed Balance Sheet

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Reserve Balances** | WRBWFRBL | Bank reserves at Fed |
| **ON RRP Facility** | RRPONTSYD | MMF cash parked at Fed |

### B. Reserve Scarcity

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **EFFR - IORB Spread** | NY Fed | **Leading 1-4 wks** |
| **Reserves vs LCLOR** | Derived | Distance to scarcity |

### C. Repo Markets

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **SOFR** | NY Fed | Secured overnight rate |
| **SOFR - IORB Spread** | Derived | Funding stress |

### D. Dealer Balance Sheets

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Dealer Net UST Position** | NY Fed | Inventory congestion |
| **GCF - TPR Spread** | Derived | Balance sheet stress |

---

## Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)

```
LCI = 0.25 × z(Reserves_vs_LCLOR)
    + 0.20 × z(-EFFR_IORB_Spread)
    + 0.15 × z(-SOFR_IORB_Spread)
    + 0.15 × z(RRP_Balance)
    + 0.10 × z(-GCF_TPR_Spread)
    + 0.10 × z(-Dealer_Net_Position)
    + 0.05 × z(-EUR_USD_Basis)
```

**Current LCI: -0.8** (Scarce)

| **LCI Range** | **Regime** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Abundant | Flush system, tailwind |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Ample | Normal functioning |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Tight | **Vigilance required** |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Scarce | **Stress emerging** |
| < -1.0 | Crisis | Intervention likely |

---

## Current State Assessment

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Reserves** | $3.3T | <$3.0T = scarcity | 🟡 **$300B cushion** |
| **RRP Balance** | $150B | <$200B = buffer gone | 🔴 **Drained** |
| **EFFR - IORB** | +3 bps | >+8 bps = stress | 🟡 **Drifting up** |
| **SOFR - IORB** | +5 bps | >+10 bps = stress | 🟡 **Elevated** |
| **GCF - TPR** | +12 bps | >+20 bps = dealer stress | 🟡 **Inflexible sheets** |
| **LCI Estimate** | **-0.8** | <-0.5 = scarce | 🔴 **Scarce Regime** |

**Narrative:** System **operating without safety margin**. RRP at $150B (down from $2.55T peak)—buffer 94% drained. Reserves at $3.3T (~$300B above LCLOR)—5 months of QT runway. Any shock hits reserves directly. The margin for error is zero.

---

## QT Endgame

**Current Math:**
- Reserves: $3.3T
- LCLOR Estimate: ~$3.0T
- Gap: $300B
- QT Pace: $60B/month
- Runway: ~5 months (May/June 2026)

**Base Case:** QT slows Q2 2026, ends Q3 2026. Some stress likely before the end.

# CROSS-PILLAR SYNTHESIS

## The MRI (Macro Risk Index)

The MRI synthesizes all 10 pillar composites:

```
MRI = 0.15 × (-LPI)                    # Labor (inverted—lower = worse)
    + 0.15 × PCI                        # Prices (higher = worse)
    + 0.15 × (-GCI)                     # Growth (inverted)
    + 0.10 × (-HCI)                     # Housing (inverted)
    + 0.10 × (-CCI)                     # Consumer (inverted)
    + 0.10 × (-BCI)                     # Business (inverted)
    + 0.05 × (-TCI)                     # Trade (inverted)
    + 0.10 × GCI_Gov                    # Government (higher = worse)
    + 0.05 × (-FCI)                     # Financial (inverted)
    + 0.05 × (-LCI)                     # Plumbing (inverted)
```

**Current MRI: +1.1** (HIGH RISK)

## Key Transmission Chains

### Labor → Consumer → Growth
```
Quits Collapse → Income Stress → Credit Usage →
Spending Cuts → Corporate Revenue ↓ → Layoffs →
Reinforcing Loop
```

### Government → Financial → Plumbing
```
Treasury Issuance → Reserve Drain → Dealer Congestion →
Repo Stress → Credit Tightening → Risk Asset Repricing
```

### Prices → Fed Policy → Housing
```
Elevated Inflation → Fed Holds → Mortgage Rates High →
Housing Frozen → Wealth Effect Impaired → Consumer Weak
```

## Current State: The Policy Trap

The economy is caught in a **policy trap**:

1. **Labor is fragile** (LFI +0.93) → Needs rate cuts
2. **Inflation is elevated** (PCI +0.7) → Prevents rate cuts
3. **Fiscal is dominant** (GCI-Gov +1.1) → Long rates stay high regardless
4. **Plumbing is thin** (LCI -0.8) → Rate cuts less effective

**The Fed's Dilemma:**
- Cut to support labor → Risk inflation reignition
- Hold to fight inflation → Risk recession
- Either way → Fiscal dominance keeps long rates elevated

---

## Conclusion

The 10 Macro Pillars paint a consistent picture: **late-cycle stress with elevated systemic risk**.

| **Pillar** | **Signal** | **Weight** |
|---|---|---|
| Labor | Pre-recessionary fragility | Bearish |
| Prices | Elevated, "last mile" stuck | Neutral |
| Growth | Manufacturing recession spreading | Bearish |
| Housing | Frozen equilibrium | Bearish |
| Consumer | Fatigued, credit stress building | Bearish |
| Business | Small biz collapsing, large cap holding | Bearish |
| Trade | Structural headwind | Bearish |
| Government | Fiscal Dominance engaged | Bearish (long rates) |
| Financial | Spreads mispriced, divergence | Caution |
| Plumbing | Buffer exhausted | Bearish |

**MRI +1.1 = HIGH RISK regime.** Defensive positioning warranted. Underweight cyclicals. Overweight quality, cash, short duration. Watch for spread widening as the catalyst.

**That's our view from the Watch. Until next time, we'll be sure to keep the light on....**
