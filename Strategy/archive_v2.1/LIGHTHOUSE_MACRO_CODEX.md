# I. PHILOSOPHY & CORE PRINCIPLES

## The Lighthouse Macro Thesis

Lighthouse Macro operates at the intersection of **systematic rigor** and **discretionary execution**. We are not a quant fund running black-box algorithms. We are not a discretionary shop making gut calls. We are something different: **a systematic process that informs high-conviction discretionary positioning**.

The analogy: A lighthouse doesn't steer ships. It illuminates the rocks. Our indicators, frameworks, and data pipelines illuminate regime shifts, transmission mechanisms, and risk asymmetries. The human—you—steers the ship.

### Core Differentiators

**1. Regime-Driven, Not Narrative-Driven**
- Positions based on quantifiable indicators with explicit invalidation criteria
- We don't trade stories; we trade measurable state changes
- Every thesis has a kill condition

**2. Cross-Domain Synthesis**
- Labor → Credit → Equities transmission chains that specialists miss
- Fed plumbing → Asset price feedback loops
- Crypto-TradFi liquidity linkages

**3. Leading Indicators Over Lagging Confirmation**
- 3-9 month forward visibility before consensus recognition
- Flows precede stocks: Quits rate tells you more than unemployment rate
- Plumbing precedes policy: RRP exhaustion matters before Fed pivot

**4. Concentration Over Diversification**
- 3-5 high-conviction bets outperform 30+ marginal positions
- Position sizing IS alpha—not just risk management
- Cash as active position (30-70% valid when conviction low)

**5. Downside Protection Focus**
- 2.35 Sortino ratio prioritizes limiting losses
- Dual stop-loss framework: thesis-based AND price-based
- Regime-based de-risking before drawdowns materialize

---

## The "Iceberg" Metaphor

What the world sees: Clean charts, sharp insights, one-liner conclusions.

What sits beneath: Massive data infrastructure, automated ETL pipelines, dozens of proprietary indicators, hundreds of data series, years of institutional experience.

**Your job as analyst:** Operate both layers. Understand the plumbing that produces the signals, AND develop the judgment to translate signals into positioning.

---

# II. THE THREE-ENGINE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

Every trade, every thesis, every piece of research must pass through the **Three-Engine Framework**. Single-engine signals are insufficient. We require **convergence across engines** for high-conviction positioning.

## Engine 1: Macro Dynamics (Pillars 1-7)

**Focus:** Labor, Prices, Growth, Housing, Consumer, Business, Trade

**Core Transmission Chain:** Labor → Income → Spending → Profits

**Key Insight:** Flows precede stocks. Labor market deterioration shows up in quits rate and hires/quits ratio 6-9 months before unemployment rises.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** | **Current** | **Signal** |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Quits Rate | < 2.0% = Pre-recessionary | 1.9% | 🔴 Breach |
| Long-Term Unemployed | > 22% = Fragility | 25.7% | 🔴 Breach |
| Hires/Quits Ratio | < 2.0 = Demand weakening | 1.85 | 🔴 Breach |
| Temp Help YoY | < -3% = Recession signal | -7.1% | 🔴 Breach |
| Core PCE | > 2.5% = Elevated | 3.2% | 🔴 Above target |
| ISM Manufacturing | < 48 = Recession | 49.3 | ⚠️ Contraction |

**LFI Current: +0.93** (Elevated fragility—defensive signal)

---

## Engine 2: Monetary Mechanics (Pillars 8-10)

**Focus:** Government (Fiscal), Financial (Credit/Conditions), Plumbing (Liquidity)

**Core Principle:** Plumbing > Policy. What the Fed says matters less than how liquidity actually transmits through the system.

**Key Insight:** RRP exhaustion removes the system's shock absorber. Treasury issuance now drains reserves directly. We've entered **Fiscal Dominance**—the regime where fiscal policy overwhelms monetary policy.

### Primary Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** | **Current** | **Signal** |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| RRP Balance | < $200B = Buffer gone | $150B | 🔴 Drained |
| Reserves vs LCLOR | < $300B = Scarcity | $300B | ⚠️ At limit |
| EFFR-IORB Spread | > +8 bps = Stress | +3 bps | 🟢 OK |
| SOFR-IORB Spread | > +10 bps = Funding stress | +5 bps | 🟡 Elevated |
| Deficit/GDP | > 5% = Elevated | 7.2% | 🔴 Wartime levels |
| Term Premium | > +50 bps = Repricing | +25 bps | ⚠️ Rising |

**LCI Current: -0.8** (Scarce liquidity—monitor funding stress)

---

## Engine 3: Market Technicals (Expression & Diagnostics)

Engine 3 has **two distinct components**:

### A. Broad Market Diagnostics (Environment Check)

**Focus:** Breadth, internals, volatility regime, cross-asset correlations

**Key Insight:** This is the health check on the *environment*, not the individual position. Breadth measures reveal internal market health that headline indices obscure. When the S&P 500 makes new highs but only 40% of stocks are above their 50d MA, the generals are marching without the troops.

**Breadth Diagnostics & Conditional Forward Returns:**

We track breadth metrics and then ask: given where we are *now*, what do forward returns historically look like? The current reading frames the conditional.

| **Diagnostic** | **Current** | **Condition** | **Forward Returns (Historical)** |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| % Stocks > 20d MA | [Live] | < 30% (washed out) | Next 20d: +2.1% avg, 68% win rate |
| | | > 80% (crowded) | Next 20d: +0.3% avg, 52% win rate |
| % Stocks > 50d MA | [Live] | < 35% (washed out) | Next 63d: +4.8% avg, 71% win rate |
| | | > 85% (crowded) | Next 63d: +1.2% avg, 55% win rate |
| % Stocks > 200d MA | [Live] | < 45% (bear regime) | Next 126d: bifurcated |
| | | > 75% (bull regime) | Next 126d: +6.2% avg, elevated DD risk |
| % Stocks at 63d High | [Live] | < 3% (no leadership) | Next 20d: watch for breadth thrust |
| | | > 20% (broad breakout) | Next 63d: momentum persists |
| % Stocks at 63d Low | [Live] | > 20% (capitulation) | Next 20d: +2.8% avg mean reversion |
| | | < 2% (complacent) | Next 20d: vulnerable to shock |
| New Highs - New Lows | [Live] | < -300 for 3+ days | Next 20d: oversold bounce typical |
| | | > +300 for 5+ days | Next 63d: breadth thrust, bullish |
| SPX Drawdown | [Live] | Down >5% over 10d | Next 20d: +1.9% avg |
| | | Down >10% over 20d | Next 63d: +5.4% avg, wide distribution |

**The Framework:**
```
1. Observe current breadth reading
2. Look up historical forward returns for that condition
3. Calibrate aggression accordingly
```

This isn't prediction—it's base rates. We use this to size positions and set expectations, not to make binary bets.

**Volatility & Positioning:**

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** | **Current** | **Signal** |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| VIX | < 15 = Complacent, > 25 = Fear | ~18 | ⚠️ Elevated |
| VIX Term Structure | Contango = Calm, Backwardation = Fear | Contango | 🟢 OK |
| HY OAS | < 300 bps = Complacent | 290 bps | 🔴 Too tight |
| Equity-Bond Correlation | > +0.3 = Diversification breaking | Rising | ⚠️ Watch |

---

### B. Position-Level Technicals (The Actual Trade)

**Focus:** The specific asset's trend, momentum, structure, and relative strength

**Key Insight:** This is completely separate from broad market diagnostics. Engine 3A tells you *whether* to be aggressive or defensive. Position-level technicals tell you *what* to buy and *when* to buy it.

**The 3-Panel Chart:**

| **Panel** | **What It Shows** | **Decision** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Panel 1: Price & Trend** | Price, 50d MA, 200d MA | Is the trend intact? |
| **Panel 2: Relative Strength** | Asset/Benchmark ratio with 63d & 252d MAs | Is it outperforming? |
| **Panel 3: Momentum (Z-RoC)** | Z-scored rate of change | Is momentum confirming? |

**Position-Level Checklist (Before Any Entry):**

| **Element** | **Requirement** | **Fail = No Trade** |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Price vs 200d MA | Price > 200d MA | ❌ Absolute Rule #1 |
| 50d vs 200d MA | 50d > 200d (no death cross) | ❌ Absolute Rule #2 |
| MA Direction | Both MAs rising | ⚠️ Reduced conviction |
| Relative Strength | Green panel (outperforming) | ❌ Absolute Rule #3 |
| Z-RoC | > -1.0 (momentum not broken) | ❌ Exit signal if held |
| Extension | Within 15% of 50d MA | ❌ Absolute Rule #5 |

**The Interaction:**

```
BROAD MARKET (Engine 3A)         POSITION TECHNICALS (Engine 3B)
        ↓                                ↓

        ↓                                ↓
  "Should I be aggressive       "Is THIS asset ready
   or defensive overall?"         to buy right now?"
        ↓                                ↓
   Regime Multiplier             Conviction Score
        ↓                                ↓

## Engine Synthesis: The Macro Risk Index (MRI)

The MRI is the **master composite** that synthesizes all three engines via the 10 pillar composites:

```
MRI = 0.15 × (-LPI)           # Labor (inverted: low = worse)
    + 0.15 × PCI              # Prices (high = worse)
    + 0.15 × (-GCI)           # Growth (inverted)
    + 0.10 × (-HCI)           # Housing (inverted)
    + 0.10 × (-CCI)           # Consumer (inverted)
    + 0.10 × (-BCI)           # Business (inverted)
    + 0.05 × (-TCI)           # Trade (inverted)
    + 0.10 × GCI_Gov          # Government (high = worse)
    + 0.05 × (-FCI)           # Financial (inverted)
    + 0.05 × (-LCI)           # Plumbing (inverted)
```

### MRI Signal Thresholds

| **MRI Range** | **Regime** | **Equity Allocation** | **Regime Multiplier** |
|---------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| < -0.5 | Low Risk | 65-70% | 1.2x |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | 55-60% | 1.0x |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | 45-55% | 0.6x |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Risk | 35-45% | 0.3x |
| > +1.5 | Crisis | 25-35% | 0.0x (cash) |

**Historical Performance:**
- Recession prediction precision: 100% (no false positives when MRI > 1.0)
- Average lead time: 9 months from MRI signal to recession start
- Correlation with forward 6m SPX return: -0.42

**Current Reading:** MRI = +1.1 (HIGH RISK → Regime Multiplier: 0.3x)

# III. THE 10 MACRO PILLARS

Our macro surveillance is organized into 10 distinct sector pillars. Each pillar has dedicated data series, leading indicators, composite indices, and regime classifications.

### Current Pillar State (January 2026)

| **Pillar** | **Composite** | **Regime** | **Key Signal** |
|------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **1. Labor** | LPI -0.6, LFI +0.93 | Softening/Fragile | Quits 1.9% (pre-recessionary) |
| **2. Prices** | PCI +0.7 | Elevated | Core PCE 3.2% (60% above target) |
| **3. Growth** | GCI -0.4 | Contraction Risk | Manufacturing 26-month recession |
| **4. Housing** | HCI -0.6 | Contraction | Frozen equilibrium, 30-year low sales |
| **5. Consumer** | CCI -0.3 | Fatigued | Savings depleted, credit stress building |
| **6. Business** | BCI -0.4 | Slowing | NFIB 89.4 (lowest since 2012) |
| **7. Trade** | TCI -0.5 | Headwind | Tariff pass-through, strong dollar |
| **8. Government** | GCI-Gov +1.1 | High Stress | Fiscal Dominance, 7.2% deficit/GDP |
| **9. Financial** | FCI +0.3 | Neutral (Divergent) | Spreads too tight for fundamentals |
| **10. Plumbing** | LCI -0.8 | Scarce | RRP exhausted, buffer gone |

### Pillar-to-Trade Mapping

| **Pillar Signal** | **Trading Expression** | **Asset Class** |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| LFI > +0.8 | Reduce cyclical equity exposure | Equities |
| LCI < -0.5 | Reduce gross exposure, add cash | All |
| CLG < -1.0 | Add credit protection (HY short) | Credit |
| PCI > +1.0 | Short duration, inflation hedges | Rates |
| GCI-Gov > +1.0 | Steepener trades, term premium | Rates |
| BCI < -0.5 | Underweight small caps vs large | Equities |
| HCI < -0.5 | Avoid homebuilders, housing-sensitive | Equities |

# IV. PROPRIETARY INDICATORS REFERENCE

## Primary Composite Indices

### 1. Labor Fragility Index (LFI)

**Purpose:** Detect structural labor weakness before headline unemployment rises.

```python
LFI = 0.30 × z(Long_Term_Unemployed_Share)
    + 0.25 × z(-Quits_Rate)                    # Inverted
    + 0.20 × z(-Hires_Quits_Ratio)             # Inverted
    + 0.15 × z(-Temp_Help_YoY)                 # Inverted
    + 0.10 × z(-Job_Hopper_Premium)            # Inverted
```

**Interpretation:**
- LFI < 0: Labor market healthy
- LFI 0-0.5: Neutral to softening
- LFI 0.5-1.0: Fragility developing → reduce cyclical exposure
- LFI > 1.0: Severe fragility → recession risk elevated

**Lead Time:** LFI leads unemployment by 6-9 months, credit spreads by 3-6 months.

**Current: +0.93** (Elevated Fragility)

---

### 2. Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)

**Purpose:** Measure system shock-absorption capacity.

```python
LCI = 0.25 × z(Reserves_vs_LCLOR)
    + 0.20 × z(-EFFR_IORB_Spread)               # Inverted
    + 0.15 × z(-SOFR_IORB_Spread)               # Inverted
    + 0.15 × z(RRP_Balance)
    + 0.10 × z(-GCF_TPR_Spread)                 # Inverted
    + 0.10 × z(-Dealer_Net_Position)            # Inverted
    + 0.05 × z(-EUR_USD_Basis)                  # Inverted
```

**Interpretation:**
- LCI > +1.0: Abundant liquidity—flush system, tailwind
- LCI +0.5 to +1.0: Ample—normal functioning
- LCI -0.5 to +0.5: Tight—vigilance required
- LCI -1.0 to -0.5: Scarce—stress emerging
- LCI < -1.0: Crisis—intervention likely

**Current: -0.8** (Scarce—buffer exhausted)

---

### 3. Credit-Labor Gap (CLG)

**Purpose:** Identify when credit markets are ignoring labor reality.

```python
CLG = z(HY_OAS) - z(LFI)
```

**Interpretation:**
- CLG > +1.0: Credit pricing in stress labor doesn't show
- CLG -1.0 to +1.0: Aligned
- CLG < -1.0: Credit too tight given labor deterioration → pre-widening setup

**Current: -1.2** (Credit complacent—spreads 100-150 bps too tight)

---

### 4. Pillar Composite Indices

Each pillar has its own composite index. See **PROPRIETARY INDICATORS REFERENCE.md** for complete formulas.

| **Index** | **Current** | **Regime** |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| LPI (Labor Pillar) | -0.6 | Softening |
| PCI (Prices Pillar) | +0.7 | Elevated |
| GCI (Growth Pillar) | -0.4 | Contraction Risk |
| HCI (Housing Pillar) | -0.6 | Contraction |
| CCI (Consumer Pillar) | -0.3 | Fatigued |
| BCI (Business Pillar) | -0.4 | Slowing |
| TCI (Trade Pillar) | -0.5 | Headwind |
| GCI-Gov (Government) | +1.1 | High Stress |
| FCI (Financial) | +0.3 | Neutral (Divergent) |
| LCI (Plumbing) | -0.8 | Scarce |

---

## Secondary Indicators

### Treasury Market Stress Dashboard

Four independent metrics tracked simultaneously:

| **Metric** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Status** |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Auction Tail Frequency | 35% | < 15% historical | 🔴 |
| Foreign Demand | 63.8% | ~70% historical | 🔴 |
| Dealer Capacity | 96% of SLR | < 85% comfortable | 🔴 |
| Funding Stress | SOFR +5 bps | < 15 bps | 🟢 |

**Assessment:** 3 of 4 red = Structural weakness

### Yield-Funding Stress (YFS)

```python
YFS = average([
    z(10Y_2Y_Spread),
    z(10Y_3M_Spread),
    z(BGCR_EFFR_Spread)
])
```

### Equity Momentum Divergence (EMD)

```python
EMD = z((SP500 - SP500_MA) / Realized_Volatility)
```

**Interpretation:**
- EMD > +1σ: Stretched momentum, prone to air pockets
- EMD near 0: Normal conditions
- EMD < -1σ: Oversold, potential mean reversion

# V. FED PLUMBING & LIQUIDITY TRANSMISSION

## Key Entities & Market Actors

| **Entity** | **Role** | **Key Data** |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Federal Reserve** | Administered rates, balance sheet | H.4.1, SOMA holdings |
| **U.S. Treasury** | TGA, bill curve, issuance | Treasury statements |
| **Primary Dealers** | Market making, repo with HFs/MMFs | FR 2004, positions |
| **Hedge Funds** | Basis trades, leverage | CFTC, repo borrowing |
| **Money Market Funds** | RRP usage, bill buying | N-MFP, allocation |
| **Banks** | Reserve holders, Fed Funds | Call reports, H.8 |
| **FHLBs** | Liquidity recycling | FHLB disclosures |
| **Foreign Official** | FRP, custody holdings | TIC data |

## The Rates Ladder

```
CEILING │  Fed FX Swap Lines (emergency)
        │  FIMA Repo Facility
        ├─────────────────────────────────────────
        │  Standing Repo Facility (SRF)

## Liquidity Transmission Framework

Stress propagates sequentially:

```
Stage 1: RRP Depletion          ← COMPLETE ($150B, 94% drained)
    ↓
Stage 2: Reserve Drainage       ← IN PROGRESS ($3.3T, QT continuing)
    ↓
Stage 3: SRF Usage Surge        ← APPROACHING (EFFR drifting up)
    ↓
Stage 4: Collateral Stress
    ↓
Stage 5: Stablecoin Flow Stalls
    ↓
Stage 6: Perp Basis Collapse
    ↓
Stage 7: Crypto Liquidations
```

**Critical Insight:** Liquidity hasn't disappeared—it stopped absorbing risk and now transmits it downstream.

# VI. POSITION CONSTRUCTION & RISK MANAGEMENT

## Asset Class Framework

### Core Portfolio (90% of capital)

| **Asset Class** | **Range** | **Primary Instrument** |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **U.S. Equities** | 40-70% | SPY, VTI, sector ETFs |
| **U.S. Bonds** | 20-50% | AGG, TLT, SHY |
| **Cash** | 0-30% | SGOV, money market |

### Tactical Overlays (10% of capital, rotational)

| **Asset Class** | **Range** | **Use Case** |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Gold** | 0-10% | Crisis hedge, real rate hedge |
| **Commodities** | 0-10% | Inflation hedge |
| **International** | 0-15% | VEA, VWO |
| **Sector Tilts** | 0-20% | Defensive (XLU, XLP) or Cyclical (XLY, XLF) |
| **Volatility** | 0-5% | VXX, TAIL |
| **Crypto** | 0-10% | BTC, ETH, spot ETFs |

## Position Limits (Hard Limits—Never Exceed)

| **Limit Type** | **Maximum** |
|----------------|-------------|
| Single position | 30% |
| Sector concentration | 40% |
| Gross exposure | 100% (no leverage) |
| Minimum liquidity | 5% for rebalancing |
| Correlated positions (ρ > 0.7) | Combined < 40% |

## The Six Absolute Rules

Before any trade consideration, these filters must pass. If any fail, the trade doesn't happen.

**Rule 1: Never Own Below 200d MA**
- Below 200d = long-term downtrend. No exceptions.

**Rule 2: Never Own When 50d < 200d (Death Cross)**
- Short-term momentum counter to long-term trend = danger zone.

**Rule 3: Never Own a Relative Downtrend**
- If asset underperforming benchmark, capital better deployed elsewhere.

**Rule 4: Never Add to Losers**
- Averaging down violates trend-following philosophy.

**Rule 5: Never Chase Above +15% Extension from 50d MA**
- Parabolic moves mean revert violently.

**Rule 6: Never Fight the Macro Regime**
- MRI > +1.5 = Crisis = no new equity longs regardless of setup quality.

## Dual Stop-Loss Framework

Every position has TWO exit triggers. Use whichever fires first.

### 1. Thesis-Based Stops (Fundamental Invalidation)

Exit when regime indicators reverse:
- LFI drops below 0.0 (labor stabilizing)
- Quits rate rises above 2.1% (confidence returning)
- Fed announces emergency liquidity intervention
- Credit spreads widen > 500 bps (stress already priced)
- MRI drops below +0.5 (risk normalizing)

### 2. Price-Based Stops (Technical Invalidation)

Exit when technical structure breaks:
- 50d MA crosses below 200d MA
- Relative strength breaks support
- Stop-loss triggered (-5% to -10% depending on volatility)
- Z-RoC < -1.0 (momentum breakdown)

**Rule:** Preserve capital → Reassess → Re-enter when signals realign.

## Drawdown Protocols

# VII. POSITION SIZING & CONVICTION FRAMEWORK

## The Regime-Conviction-Size Formula

```
Position Size = Regime_Multiplier × Conviction_Weight × Liquidity_Adjustment
```

**Components:**
1. **Regime Multiplier** (0.0x to 1.2x): Set by MRI
2. **Conviction Weight** (0% to 20%): Set by Conviction Tier
3. **Liquidity Adjustment** (0.5x to 1.0x): Asset-specific

---

## Conviction Scoring System

**Total Possible: 19 points**
- Technical Score: 0-9 pts
- Fundamental Score: 0-5 pts
- Microstructure Score: 0-5 pts

### Technical Score Components (0-9 pts)

**1. Primary Trend (0-2 pts)**

## The Perfect Setup: Six-Element Configuration

The Perfect Setup is the **only configuration** that justifies maximum position sizing.

**Element 1: Primary Trend Structure**
- Price > 50d MA > 200d MA
- **Both MAs rising** (not just aligned, but ascending)

**Element 2: Relative Trend Alignment**
- Asset outperforming benchmark (Panel 2 = Green)
- Relative price > Relative 63d MA > Relative 252d MA

**Element 3: Consolidation Pattern**
- Sideways price action for 10-30 days after prior uptrend leg
- Volatility compression (ATR declining)
- Price oscillating around rising 50d MA

**Element 4: Momentum Behavior During Consolidation**
- Z-RoC was strong (+1.0 to +2.0) leading into consolidation
- Z-RoC cooled to -0.5 to +0.5 during consolidation
- **Key:** Momentum dissipated but didn't collapse (never hit -1.0)

**Element 5: Breakout Trigger**
- Price breaks above consolidation range
- Z-RoC crosses back above 0 (momentum resuming)
- Volume expansion on breakout

**Element 6: Macro Regime Confirmation**
- MRI not in Crisis territory (< +1.5)
- LCI not critically scarce (> -1.0)

## Position Size Examples by Regime

**High Conviction Setup (Tier 1, Score 17) in Different Regimes:**

| **Regime** | **MRI** | **Multiplier** | **Conviction** | **Size** |
|------------|---------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Low Risk | -0.6 | 1.2x | 20% | 24% |
| Neutral | +0.3 | 1.0x | 20% | 20% |
| Elevated | +0.8 | 0.6x | 20% | 12% |
| High Risk | +1.2 | 0.3x | 20% | 6% |
| Crisis | +1.8 | 0.0x | 20% | 0% (cash) |

**Current Regime (MRI +1.1):**
- Tier 1 (20% base) → 20% × 0.3 = **6% maximum position**
- Tier 2 (12% base) → 12% × 0.3 = **3.6% maximum position**
- Tier 3 (7% base) → 7% × 0.3 = **2.1% maximum position**

# VIII. TACTICAL TIMEFRAME FRAMEWORK

## The 3-6 Month Sweet Spot

Research across 80+ years demonstrates the **3-6 month tactical horizon** represents an empirically-validated sweet spot where:
- Macro forecast accuracy remains meaningful (GDP errors 1-2 ppts)
- Momentum signals maintain positive persistence
- Fed policy effects are predictable
- Transaction costs stay manageable

### Momentum Signal Persistence

| **Lookback** | **Holding Period** | **Sharpe Ratio** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 12 months | 1 month | > 1.0 |
| 12 months | 3 months | 0.8-1.0 |
| 12 months | 6 months | 0.5-0.8 |

**Magic Number:** Formation period + holding period = 14-18 months optimal.

**The 12-14 Month Danger Zone:** Momentum-to-mean-reversion transition. Exit or reverse by month 12-14.

## The Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Strategic-Tactical Core (60-70% risk budget)
- **Timeframe:** 3-6 months
- **Adjustment:** Monthly to quarterly
- **Focus:** Business cycle phase, Fed policy cycle, credit cycle
- **Signal Source:** MRI, LFI, LCI regime changes

### Layer 2: Tactical Intermediate (20-30% risk budget)
- **Timeframe:** 1-3 months
- **Adjustment:** Weekly to monthly
- **Focus:** Rotations within macro regime
- **Signal Source:** Relative strength rotation, sector momentum

### Layer 3: Event-Driven Overlays (10-20% risk budget)
- **Timeframe:** 1-3 weeks
- **Focus:** FOMC meetings, major data releases, stress episodes

## Key Timing Parameters

### Fed Policy Transmission
- **Pre-FOMC equity drift:** Begins ~25 days before meeting (49 bps avg, 1.14 Sharpe)
- **Post-FOMC Treasury drift:** Peaks at exactly 50 trading days (120+ bps)
- **Terminal rate holding period:** Average 5.5 months (range 0-15)
- **Markets anticipate pivots:** 3-6 months before first cut

### Business Cycle Transmission
- **ISM inflection points:** 4-7 months to play out
- **Manufacturing leads services:** 2-4 months
- **Labor market recognition lag:** 6-9 months
- **Equity market discount:** 3-6 months ahead of labor

## Rebalancing Protocols

### Threshold-Based (Primary Method)
- Monitor positions every 1-2 weeks
- Rebalance when any position drifts > 20% from target
- Benefit: +55 bps annual vs no rebalancing, +22 bps vs calendar

### Signal-Driven
Rebalance when MRI crosses key thresholds (+0.5, +1.0, +1.5).

# IX. CRYPTO & DIGITAL ASSETS INTEGRATION

## Philosophy: Crypto as Liquidity Expression

Crypto is not a hedge against macro. It is a **leveraged expression of macro liquidity**.

The transmission chain:
```
Policy → Liquidity Plumbing → Dealer Balance Sheets →
Stablecoin Supply → Perps Liquidity → Price Action
```

**Stablecoin supply is crypto's M2.** When stablecoin supply grows, risk-taking improves. When it shrinks, deleveraging accelerates.

## Benchmark Selection Framework

### Tier 1: BTC as Universal Default (80% of positions)
**Use for:** L1 competitors, infrastructure, store-of-value alternatives, cross-chain protocols.
**Logic:** BTC is the opportunity cost of holding anything else.

### Tier 2: ETH for Ethereum Ecosystem (15% of positions)
**Use for:** L2s (ARB, OP), DeFi protocols (UNI, AAVE), ETH-denominated assets.
**Logic:** These are leveraged bets on Ethereum's success.
**Important:** Also check ETH/BTC.

### Tier 3: Sector Indices (5% of positions)
**Use for:** Sophisticated multi-position strategies with sector rotation overlay.

## Crypto Position Sizing

### Regime Multipliers

| **Regime** | **LCI Signal** | **Stablecoin Supply** | **Multiplier** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Supportive | > 0 | Growing | 1.0x |
| Neutral | -0.5 to 0 | Flat | 0.6x |
| Restrictive | < -0.5 | Shrinking | 0.3x |

### Liquidity Adjustment

| **Market Cap Rank** | **Adjustment** |
|---------------------|----------------|
| BTC, ETH | 1.0x |
| Top 10 | 0.9x |
| Top 11-50 | 0.7x |
| Top 51-100 | 0.5x |
| Outside Top 100 | 0.3x or avoid |

### Volatility Adjustment
- Crypto positions should generally be sized 40-60% of equivalent conviction equity positions
- Example: Tier 1 equity = 20%, Tier 1 crypto = 8-12%

# Immediate Action Items for New Analyst

1. **Master the Three Engines:** Understand how Macro Dynamics, Monetary Mechanics, and Market Technicals interact.

2. **Learn the Indicators:** Be able to calculate LFI, LCI, CLG, and MRI by hand. Know what each component means.

3. **Study the Plumbing:** The Fed's balance sheet mechanics are the least understood and most important part of macro analysis.

4. **Internalize the Absolute Rules:** Six rules. No exceptions. Ever.

5. **Practice Conviction Scoring:** Score 10 setups using the 19-point framework before making any real trades.

6. **Run the Pipeline:** Get hands-on with the data infrastructure.

7. **Start a Research Log:** Document every thesis, every trade idea, every error. This is how you build judgment.

# Closing Framework

The Lighthouse Macro approach can be summarized in five principles:

1. **Systematic Foundation:** Quantifiable indicators with explicit thresholds provide the foundation for all analysis.

2. **Discretionary Execution:** Human judgment determines how to act on signals—the system illuminates, the analyst steers.

3. **Cross-Domain Synthesis:** The edge comes from seeing transmission chains that specialists miss.

4. **Regime Awareness:** Position sizing and conviction must adapt to the macro regime, not fight it.

5. **Continuous Refinement:** The framework evolves. Document what works, discard what doesn't, stay humble.
