## Labor is the Engine

There is no economy without labor. People make things, build things, produce things. Then they spend the income they earn. Then they service the debt they've accumulated. Everything downstream flows from employment.

This isn't a metaphor. It's a transmission chain:

**Labor → Consumer:** Income determines spending capacity. No job means no spending. Reduced hours means reduced spending. Employment stress hits personal consumption (68% of GDP) within 1-3 months.

**Labor → Credit:** Employment stress precedes default risk. When workers lose income, they can't service debt. Credit card delinquencies, auto delinquencies, mortgage delinquencies... they follow job losses with a 3-6 month lag.

**Labor → Housing:** Job stability drives home-buying decisions. Nobody buys a house when they're worried about layoffs. Housing activity follows labor conditions with a 6-9 month lag.

**Labor → Growth:** Hours worked contracts before output falls. You can't produce without workers, and employers cut hours before headcount. Labor weakness shows up in GDP within 2-4 months.

This is why we weight labor heavily in our framework. It's not that labor "predicts" the economy. Labor IS the economy, measured in real-time. Understand the labor situation, and you understand the economic situation.

## The Core Insight: Flows Lead Stocks

Here's what separates our approach from consensus: labor data splits into two categories.

**Flows** are the movements: quits, hires, separations, temp help changes. These are dynamic. They measure what's happening at the margin right now.

**Stocks** are the levels: unemployment rate, total payrolls, labor force participation. These are cumulative. They measure the result of many past decisions.

The distinction matters because **flows lead stocks by 6-9 months**. By the time unemployment rises meaningfully, quits have usually been declining for quarters. The sequence is consistent across cycles.

But here's a subtlety most analysts miss: **direction changes lead, even for "lagging" indicators.** The unemployment rate is called lagging because its *level* peaks after recession ends. But its *trough* (the turn from falling to rising) actually precedes recession by 4-13 months historically. Same pattern holds across most labor indicators. Watch the turn, not just the level.

Think about it mechanically. When an employer senses trouble ahead, they don't immediately fire workers. They freeze hiring. They stop backfilling positions. They cut hours. They let temp contracts expire. These show up in flows. Only later, when the situation becomes undeniable, do they start layoffs. Those show up in stocks.

Same dynamic on the worker side. When workers sense trouble, they stop quitting for new jobs. They stay put. Quits decline. Only later, when layoffs actually happen, does unemployment rise.

The gap between flows and stocks is where consensus gets caught. Headlines focus on unemployment. "Labor market remains strong!" But the flows have already turned.

## What We Actually Track

No single indicator captures every cycle perfectly. That's why we use multiple indicators serving different purposes. We call this the mosaic approach.

For every indicator, we analyze four dimensions:
- **Level:** Where is it now?
- **Direction:** Rising or falling?
- **Trend:** Sustained move or noise?
- **Rate of Change:** How fast is it moving?

This matters because different dimensions have different lead times. The unemployment rate's *level* lags recession, but its *direction change* (the trough) leads by 4-13 months. Same for most labor indicators. The turn is often the signal.

### Leading Indicators (Early Warning)

These move first. They tell us where we're going before we get there.

**Temp Help Employment (YoY):** Temp workers are the first hired in expansions and the first fired in contractions. When employers sense trouble, temp contracts don't get renewed. The key insight: you won't have a recession while temp help is expanding. Direction matters, not level.

**Quits Rate:** Workers vote with their feet. When quits decline, workers are sensing something that employers haven't announced yet. Both level and direction matter. The 2.0% threshold with a declining trend is the clearest stress signal.

**Hires-to-Quits Ratio:** This measures labor demand strength. When employers are competing for workers, hires exceed quits by a healthy margin (above 2.0). When demand softens, the ratio compresses. Below 2.0 signals weakening.

**Initial Claims (Weekly):** The highest-frequency stress gauge we have. Claims data arrives weekly, filling the gap between monthly releases. A 4-week moving average above 250k signals stress building.

### Breadth Indicators (How Widespread?)

Flow indicators tell us stress is developing. Breadth indicators tell us whether it's localized or spreading.

**State Unemployment Diffusion:** What percentage of states are showing rising unemployment? When weakness is confined to one or two states, it might be idiosyncratic. When 50%+ of states are rising simultaneously, that's a national problem developing.

**Sector Employment Diffusion:** Same logic applied to industries. Are layoffs concentrated in one sector or spreading across the economy?

### Confirming Indicators (Level Lags, Direction Leads)

**Long-Term Unemployed Share:** The *level* peaks during or after recessions (lagging). But the *direction change* is leading. When LT share stops falling and starts rising, workers are taking longer to find jobs. Historical data shows LT share troughed 3-13 months before recession in all three post-2000 cycles. Watch the turn, not the level.

**Unemployment Rate:** The level is the ultimate lagging indicator. By the time it rises meaningfully, the deterioration has been underway for quarters. But its *trough* (the turn from falling to rising) actually leads recession by 4-13 months. When the direction change confirms what the flows were showing, you know the signal was real.

### High-Frequency Bridge

**Initial Claims:** Weekly data that fills the 5-6 week gap between monthly JOLTS releases. When claims spike, you don't have to wait for the next jobs report.

## The Validation

We don't use indicators because they sound smart. We use them because they've worked.

We validated each signal against the three post-2000 recessions (2001, 2008, 2020). Here's what we found:

| Signal | Track Record | Typical Lead Time |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Temp Help YoY negative | 3/3 recessions | 1-12 months |
| Hires/Quits ratio below 2.0 | 3/3 recessions | 1-23 months |
| State unemployment diffusion above 50% | 3/3 recessions | 2-14 months |

We also validated direction changes (peaks and troughs) against these recessions:

| Indicator | Turn Type | 2001 Lead | 2008 Lead | 2020 Lead |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Quits Rate | Peak → Decline | 1 mo | 22 mo | 11 mo |
| Unemployment Rate | Trough → Rise | 10 mo | 13 mo | 4 mo |
| LT Unemployed Share | Trough → Rise | 3 mo | 13 mo | 12 mo |
| Hires/Quits Ratio | Peak → Decline | 2 mo | 2 mo | 15 mo |

**Important caveat:** JOLTS data (quits, hires, openings) only begins December 2000, which limits our sample to three recessions. COVID was an exogenous shock with unusual patterns. The framework is empirically grounded but sample-limited. We're honest about that.

The signal isn't any single indicator. It's **convergence**. When multiple flow indicators deteriorate simultaneously, stocks follow. When only one is flashing, it might be noise.

## The Microstructure: Job-Hopper Premium

One indicator deserves special attention because it captures something the aggregate data misses.

The Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker tracks wage growth for job switchers versus job stayers. In a healthy labor market, workers who change jobs earn more than those who stay. The "job-hopper premium" typically runs 1-2 percentage points.

When the premium collapses to near zero, something has changed. Workers aren't seeing better opportunities elsewhere. Employers aren't competing for talent. This collapse has historically only occurred around recessions.

It's a microstructure signal. Individual workers, making individual decisions, revealing what the aggregate data won't show for months.

## Where We Are Now

The stocks look fine:
- Unemployment rate: 4.4% (unremarkable)
- Prime-age labor force participation: 83.8% (healthy)
- Payrolls: Still positive (though slowing)

The flows are deteriorating:
- Temp help: Negative YoY (validated leading indicator, flashing)
- Hires/Quits ratio: Below 2.0 threshold (validated, confirmed)
- State diffusion: Above 50% (broad-based, validated)
- Quits rate: At 2.0% and declining (late-cycle)
- Job-hopper premium: Near zero (collapsed)

This is the classic late-cycle pattern. Headlines focus on stocks. "Strong labor market." We focus on flows. "Late-cycle stress building."

The unemployment rate will catch up. It always does. The question is whether you're watching the flows that lead or the stocks that lag.

## The Bottom Line

Labor analysis isn't about any single number. It's about understanding the transmission chain (labor drives everything downstream), the lead/lag structure (flows move first, stocks follow), the four dimensions (level + direction + trend + rate of change), and the convergence of signals (one indicator flashing might be noise, multiple indicators flashing is signal).

We track:
- **Leading indicators** for early warning
- **Breadth indicators** for how widespread
- **Confirming indicators** to validate the signal
- **High-frequency data** to fill the gaps

When multiple validated indicators flash simultaneously, that's not noise. That's the labor market telling us something the headline unemployment rate won't show for months.
