# Lighthouse Macro Core Frameworks & Research Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document codifies Lighthouse Macro's analytical engine — a unified, falsifiable macro framework integrating economic cycles, monetary plumbing, and market structure into actionable intelligence. Every component is empirically grounded, reproducible, and designed for institutional deployment.

---

## I. Foundational Architecture

### Core Identity: Macro, Illuminated

Lighthouse Macro integrates economic cycles, labor + consumer flows, monetary plumbing, credit conditions, and cross-asset market structure into a single, falsifiable, action-oriented macro engine.

**Guiding Principles:**
- **Cycle-aware:** Diagnose regime and direction of travel
- **Flow-driven:** Labor → income → spending → profits → credit → employment  
- **Liquidity-first:** RRP, SOFR–EFFR, repo, dealer balance sheets
- **Feedback loops over snapshots**
- **Flexible, adaptive, and willing to expand the framework as the world changes**

---

## II. The Three Pillars Framework

### Pillar 1: Macro Dynamics

**Definition:** The structural forces driving the real economy — growth, inflation, employment, housing, trade, demographics, fiscal flows, and capital formation.

**Focus Areas:**
- GDP & Output Gaps
- Inflation Momentum  
- Fiscal Impulse
- Capital Expenditure
- Demographics
- Commodity Supply

**Asset Lens:** Equities, Credit, Commodities, Currencies

### Pillar 2: Monetary Mechanics  

**Definition:** The plumbing of global liquidity — where central-bank policy meets collateral, reserves, and funding.

**Focus Areas:**
- Central Bank Balance Sheets
- Repo & Collateral Markets
- Bank Funding
- Term Premia
- Cross-Currency Basis

**Asset Lens:** Rates, Credit, Crypto, Currencies

### Pillar 3: Market Technicals

**Definition:** Where structure meets behavior — positioning, microstructure, liquidity depth, correlation shifts, and cross-border flows.

**Asset Lens:** Equities, Rates, Credit, Commodities, FX, Crypto

## III. Macro Regime Classification System

### Growth × Inflation Quadrants

| Quadrant | Growth | Inflation | Asset Bias |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Goldilocks** | ↑ | ↓ | Equities, Credit, Carry, Short Vol |
| **Overheating** | ↑ | ↑ | Commodities, Value, Inflation Hedges |
| **Recession** | ↓ | ↓ | Treasuries, USD, Quality Defensives |
| **Stagflation** | ↓ | ↑ | Commodities, Cash, Curve Steepeners |

**Fast Indicators:**
- ISM levels & momentum
- Core PCE trend
- Labor flows (openings, quits, temp help)

**Key Question:** Which quadrant are we in, and which quadrant are we moving toward?

---

## IV. Labor Dynamics Flow Model

### The First Core Pillar

Labor is the cycle's first turning point. Ignore stocks. Track flows.

**The Four Components:**
1. **Openings** (Demand)
2. **Hires** (Activity)
3. **Quits** (Confidence + Wage Pressure)
4. **Layoffs** (Stress)

**Core Insight:** Flows deteriorate months before unemployment rises.

### Beveridge Curve Mechanics
- **Downward move →** openings fall first (soft landing possible)
- **Rightward move →** unemployment rises (hard landing underway)
- **Outward shift →** structural mismatch, not cyclical weakness

### Sequencing Architecture
- **Leading:** openings, quits, temp help
- **Coincident:** wages, payrolls
- **Lagging:** unemployment rate

### Transmission Mechanisms

**To Inflation:**
- Quits ↑ → Wages ↑ → Services inflation ↑ → Fed hawkish
- Quits ↓ → Wages ↓ → Supercore ↓ → Fed easing window opens

**To Markets:**
- Labor softens → Credit spreads widen → Equities derate → Unemployment rises last

---

## V. Consumer-Credit Transmission Mechanism

### The Second Core Pillar

Consumer spending = 70% of GDP → must sit structurally next to labor.

### A. Income Architecture
- Aggregate payrolls
- Hours worked
- Wage growth
- Switching premia
- Real disposable income (RDI)

**Critical Signal:** RDI rollover = demand cliff

### B. Confidence Indicators
- Conference Board & Michigan Surveys
- Expectations vs Present Situation spread
- Buying intentions (autos, durables)

**Leading Signal:** Durables lead the spending cycle

### C. Credit Flow Dynamics
- Card utilization
- Delinquencies (card + auto)
- BNPL usage
- Lending standards (SLOOS)
- Household balance sheet strain

**Recession Trigger:** Income softens + credit tightens = recession

### D. Spending Composition Sequence

**Recession Cascade:**
1. Durables collapse
2. Discretionary services slow
3. Travel/leisure peaks
4. Essentials hold
5. Shelter sticky
6. Healthcare/food defensive

This composition drives earnings season rotations.

### Labor ↔ Consumer Feedback Loop

**Stage 1:** Tight labor → high income → broad spending → Fed tightens  
**Stage 2:** Labor softens → income plateaus → credit-funded spending  
**Stage 3:** Consumer stress → delinquencies rise → spending rotation  
**Stage 4:** Layoffs → income falls → spending contracts → recession

Labor gives the early signal. Consumer stress confirms.

## VI. Liquidity Transmission Framework (LTF)

### The Heart of Market Volatility

#### Four Liquidity Pillars

1. **Central Bank Liquidity** (QE/QT, balance sheet)
2. **Market Liquidity** (bid-ask, depth)
3. **Funding Liquidity** (SOFR, repo, spreads)
4. **Private Liquidity** (credit, lending, household balance sheets)

Use LTF as a traffic-light dashboard.

### RRP Dynamics
- **High →** excess liquidity
- **Drawdown →** liquidity entering markets
- **~Zero →** funding stress potential

### Funding Stress Indicators
- SOFR–EFFR spread > 15 bps = collateral scarcity
- Repo spike = volatility precursor
- Treasury issuance mix interacts with dealer constraints

### Dealer Balance Sheet Architecture

They determine:
- Treasury liquidity
- Cross-asset market stability
- Ability to absorb issuance shocks

---

## VII. Credit Cycle Architecture

### HY OAS Thresholds
- **<300 →** late-cycle euphoria
- **300–500 →** normal
- **500–800 →** stress
- **>1000 →** crisis

### EBP (Excess Bond Premium)
- Measures risk aversion vs fundamentals
- High = recession risk
- Low = risk-on but fragile

### Credit Impulse
- Leads GDP by 6–9 months
- Positive = growth tailwind
- Negative = tightening conditions

**Core Principle:** Credit is the channel through which labor + consumer weakness becomes recession.

---

## VIII. Treasury Market Microstructure

### Critical Monitoring Points
- Dealer inventory (long/short positioning)
- Swap spreads
- Cross-currency basis
- Auction performance
- Primary dealer take-down ratios
- CTA trend models (systematic interaction)
- Term premium regimes

**Key Insight:** Microstructure drives macro transmission.

---

## IX. Systemic Risk Early Warning System

### OFR FSI Framework
- **<0 =** normal
- **0–1 =** elevated
- **>1.5 =** systemic stress → Fed likely to intervene

### NY Fed Recession Model
- **30% →** begin de-risking
- **50% →** recession likely

### Additional Stress Markers
- FX basis blowouts
- Equity–bond correlation regime changes
- Vol-of-vol spikes
- Shadow banking stress
- Money market fund behavior

### Implementation Principles

## XII. Crypto as Macro Liquidity Vector

### Real-Time Global Liquidity Gauge

**Track:**
- Stablecoin supply (Crypto M2)
- BTC–VIX volatility convergence
- On/off-chain liquidity
- Crypto flows into T-bills (MMF competitor)
- Offshore/global liquidity bleed-through

**Key Insight:** Crypto markets now influence Treasury demand and dollar liquidity.

---

## XIII. Yield Curve Mechanics

### Recession Timing Tool

**The Sequence That Matters:**
Inversion → Persistence → Un-inversion → Recession

### 10Y–3M Framework
- Best recession predictor
- 30% NY Fed probability → reduce cyclical beta
- 50% → recession likely

### Curve Implications
- Deep inversion = imminent credit contraction
- Sudden steepening = recession recognition moment

Duration exposure timing comes from here.

## XIV. Inflation Architecture

### Three Analytical Layers

1. **Headline vs Core**
2. **Goods vs Services vs Shelter**
3. **Demand-pull vs Cost-push vs Wage-price spiral**

### Disinflation Sequence
Goods → Services → Shelter

### Fed Pivot Trigger
Supercore cooling + Core PCE trending toward 2%.

---

## XV. Futures Positioning & Flow Analysis

### COT Framework
- **Large Specs:** Trend followers
- **Commercials:** Mean reversion
- **Small Specs:** Contrarian signal

### Extreme Positioning Thresholds
- Z-score > 2 = crowded
- Rapid unwind = volatility catalyst

### Cross-Asset Positioning Dashboard

- Bond futures
- Currency futures
- Commodity futures
- Crypto perpetuals

---

## XVI. Institutional Behavioral Signals

- Money market flows (risk-off gauge)
- Cross-border flows (FX pressure)

### Institutional Positioning Metrics
