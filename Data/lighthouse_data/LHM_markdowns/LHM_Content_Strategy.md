## II. Visual Standards & Charting Excellence

### Design Philosophy

Charts should achieve three objectives simultaneously:
1. **Immediate comprehension** — the "aha" in under 3 seconds
2. **Deeper investigation reward** — layers of insight upon study
3. **Aesthetic distinction** — unmistakably Lighthouse Macro

### Technical Specifications

#### Color Palette
```python
LIGHTHOUSE_COLORS = {
    'ocean_blue': '#0089D1',    # Primary/Core
    'dusk_orange': '#FF4500',    # Contrast/Secondary  
    'carolina_blue': '#00BFFF',  # Highlight/Flow
    'neon_magenta': '#FF00FF',   # Structural emphasis
    'light_gray': '#D3D3D3',     # Neutral background
    'signal_green': '#00FF7F',   # Positive signal
    'warning_red': '#FF3333'     # Negative signal
}
```

#### Chart Standards
- **No gridlines** — clean, professional appearance
- **All four spines visible** — defined data space
- **Right axis primary** — natural reading flow
- **Line thickness:** 2.5-3px for visibility
- **Font:** Helvetica Neue or Arial
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 for presentations, 4:3 for documents

#### Watermark Placement
- **Top-left:** "LIGHTHOUSE MACRO" (all caps, 40% opacity)
- **Bottom-right:** "MACRO, ILLUMINATED." (with period, 30% opacity)

### Advanced Visualization Techniques

#### Dual-Axis Mastery
- Complementary data series only
- Aligned zero points when logical
- Color coding for axis association
- Clear labeling hierarchy

#### Multi-Panel Dashboards
- Consistent scale across panels
- Visual flow guides eye movement
- Grouped by analytical theme
- Summary statistics in corners

#### Dynamic Range Selection

Connect present to past:

Make complex simple without dumbing down:
