## SECTION I: PROPRIETARY INDICATORS

### MRI_Macro_Risk_Index.png

**Macro Risk Index (MRI): Our Flagship Composite Risk Indicator**

The MRI synthesizes six proprietary sub-indicators into a single normalized measure of systemic risk. When MRI reads above +1σ, markets are systematically under-pricing macro risk—historically preceding major drawdowns in 2008, 2020, and 2022. The current reading of +0.06σ suggests near-neutral risk pricing, meaning credit markets, labor conditions, and funding stress are reasonably aligned. We care about MRI because it provides advance warning when risk complacency builds across multiple market plumbing indicators simultaneously. Readings above +2σ have preceded every major crisis in the past 20 years.

---

### 01_LCI_Liquidity_Cushion_Index.png

**Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI): Banking System Reserve Capacity**

The LCI tracks the banking system's capacity to absorb shocks by combining Fed reverse repo facility balances and bank reserves, both normalized to GDP. Currently at -1.45σ, the cushion is critically depleted—the RRP has drained from $2.5T to under $300B while reserves remain flat at $3.5T. We care because a thin liquidity cushion increases fragility: dealers have less capacity to absorb Treasury supply, repo rates become volatile, and term premiums spike. When LCI falls below -2σ, history shows the Fed typically intervenes with liquidity injections or facilities. This is the single biggest risk factor in the current MRI composite.

---

### 02_LFI_Labor_Fragility_Index.png

**Labor Fragility Index (LFI): Early Warning Labor Stress Signal**

The LFI combines long-term unemployment, quits rates, and hiring efficiency into a normalized stress indicator for the labor market. At +0.57σ, it's showing moderately elevated fragility—workers are less confident (fewer quits), long-term unemployment is rising (harder to reverse), and employers are more selective in hiring. We care because labor fragility leads payroll weakness by 3-6 months, making it a forward indicator for consumer spending slowdowns. Rising LFI typically precedes recessions as companies shift from labor hoarding to outright layoffs.

---

### 03_LDI_Labor_Dynamism_Index.png

**Labor Dynamism Index (LDI): Worker Confidence and Job Market Vitality**

The LDI measures labor market "churn"—job switching, voluntary separations, and worker mobility. At -0.53σ, dynamism is below average, indicating workers are staying put (lower quits) and voluntary separations are falling relative to involuntary ones. We care because low dynamism signals deteriorating worker confidence and can become self-reinforcing: as fewer workers switch jobs, wage growth slows, spending weakens, and companies cut more. LDI declines historically precede payroll weakness by 2-3 quarters, making it a leading recession indicator.

---

### 04_CLG_Credit_Labor_Gap.png

**Credit-Labor Gap (CLG): Market Mispricing Detector**

The CLG measures divergence between credit spreads (HY OAS) and labor fragility (LFI). When CLG is positive, credit markets are pricing tighter than labor conditions warrant—meaning credit is under-pricing recession risk. At +0.05σ, the gap is essentially closed after being +1.2σ in August. We care because sustained CLG divergences signal profitable asymmetric trades: if credit is too tight vs labor, HY spreads will widen. Currently, credit and labor are aligned, suggesting no major mispricing between bond and jobs markets.

---

### 05_YFS_Yield_Funding_Stress.png

**Yield-Funding Stress (YFS): Money Market Plumbing Health**

The YFS tracks money market functioning by combining the 3M T-bill/SOFR spread and the 10Y-2Y yield curve slope. At +0.97σ, funding stress is approaching the +1σ warning threshold. T-bills are trading rich to SOFR (inverted spread), signaling safe asset scarcity, while the yield curve is flattening after inversion. We care because YFS >+1σ historically precedes dealer stress, repo volatility, and Fed liquidity interventions. If YFS breaks +1.5σ, expect term premiums to spike and the Fed to potentially ease RRP drawdown pace or expand liquidity facilities.

---

### 06_SVI_Spread_Volatility_Imbalance.png

**Spread-Volatility Imbalance (SVI): Cross-Asset Risk Pricing**

The SVI compares high-yield credit spreads to VIX levels—both should move together when pricing tail risk. At -0.15σ, there's minimal divergence, with equity volatility pricing slightly more risk than credit spreads. We care because material SVI divergences (>±1σ) signal arbitrage opportunities or systematic mispricing: if credit spreads are wide but VIX is low, one asset class is wrong. Currently, credit and equity vol markets are well-aligned, suggesting consistent risk pricing across asset classes.

---

### 07_EMD_Equity_Momentum_Divergence.png

**Equity Momentum Divergence (EMD): Market Internals Health Check**

The EMD measures divergence between equity price momentum and underlying fundamentals (earnings, credit conditions). Positive EMD means stocks are running ahead of fundamentals—momentum is overextended relative to credit spreads and labor health. We care because high EMD readings preceded the 2000 tech bubble peak and 2022 growth stock collapse. It signals when equity enthusiasm disconnects from macro reality. Negative EMD suggests stocks are oversold relative to fundamentals, offering value entry points.

---

### 08_Bill_SOFR_Spread.png

**3-Month T-Bill minus SOFR Spread: Safe Asset Scarcity Gauge**

This spread measures demand for safe assets. When T-bills trade rich to SOFR (negative spread), it indicates safe haven demand or Treasury scarcity. A widening negative spread signals funding stress or flight-to-quality flows. We care because persistent bill/SOFR inversions precede repo market volatility and Fed intervention. This is a key input to YFS and provides early warning when Treasury market plumbing becomes stressed. Watch for the spread to normalize above zero as RRP balances stabilize.

---

### 09_Payrolls_vs_Quits_Divergence.png

**Payrolls vs Quits Rate: Classic Late-Cycle Pattern**

This dual-axis chart shows payroll growth holding steady while quit rates collapse—a textbook late-cycle divergence. Workers stop quitting when confidence deteriorates, while companies continue hiring due to labor hoarding. We care because this divergence pattern preceded the 2007 and 2000 recessions by 6 months. The sequence is always: (1) quits fall, (2) payrolls decelerate, (3) layoffs spike. We're currently in phase 1-2 transition, suggesting payroll weakness 2-4 months ahead. This is a high-conviction recession precursor.

---

### 10_Hours_vs_Employment_Divergence.png

**Hours Worked vs Employment: The Leading Layoff Indicator**

Companies cut hours before headcount—this chart shows average weekly hours declining while employment growth remains positive. We care because hours are a leading indicator of layoffs by 2-4 months. The cost-cutting sequence is always: (1) freeze hiring, (2) cut hours, (3) layoffs. Currently in phase 2, this chart signals imminent payroll weakness. Persistent hours weakness with stable employment is one of the most reliable recession precursors. When hours inflect down, unemployment claims typically spike within a quarter.

---

### 11_LCI_Components.png

**LCI Component Breakdown: Reverse Repo and Bank Reserves**

This chart decomposes LCI into its two components: Fed reverse repo facility balances (z-scored) and bank reserves (z-scored), both normalized to GDP. Shows how RRP has collapsed from peak while reserves remain stagnant, creating the liquidity cushion squeeze. We care because it identifies which component drives LCI stress—currently RRP depletion is the primary culprit. This granular view helps forecast whether liquidity will tighten further (RRP can't go below zero) or stabilize.

---

### 12_LFI_Components.png

**LFI Component Breakdown: Long-Term Unemployment, Quits, and Hiring Efficiency**

Decomposes Labor Fragility Index into its three drivers: long-term unemployment share (>27 weeks), quits rate, and hires-to-quits ratio. Shows which labor market dimension is deteriorating fastest. We care because different components have different lead times: quits fall first (confidence), then hiring efficiency drops (selectivity), then long-term unemployment rises (scarring). This chart pinpoints the stage of labor market deterioration and forecasts timing to recession.

---

### 13_LDI_Components.png

**LDI Component Breakdown: Quits, Hires/Quits Ratio, and Quits/Layoffs Ratio**

Decomposes Labor Dynamism Index into job-switching (quits rate), hiring efficiency (hires/quits), and voluntary vs involuntary separations (quits/layoffs ratio). Shows the specific source of dynamism loss. We care because declining quits/layoffs ratio is an especially strong recession signal—it means companies are shifting from voluntary to involuntary separations. This granularity helps identify whether dynamism loss is cyclical (recoverable) or structural (persistent).

---

### 14_YFS_Components.png

**YFS Component Breakdown: Bill-SOFR Spread and Yield Curve Slope**

Decomposes Yield-Funding Stress into money market plumbing (3M bill-SOFR spread) and term structure (10Y-2Y slope). Shows whether funding stress comes from short-end scarcity (bill/SOFR) or curve inversion (long-end fear). We care because different components require different Fed responses: bill/SOFR stress needs liquidity facilities, curve inversion needs rate cuts. This helps forecast Fed reaction function and intervention timing.

---

### 15_CLG_Components.png

**CLG Component Breakdown: Credit Spreads vs Labor Fragility**

Decomposes Credit-Labor Gap into HY OAS (z-scored) and Labor Fragility Index. Shows when credit and labor diverge versus converge. We care because sustained divergences create asymmetric trade opportunities: if credit is too tight vs labor, HY spreads will widen. If credit is too wide, spreads will tighten. This chart identifies when to fade credit optimism or pessimism based on underlying labor fundamentals.

---

### 16_HY_OAS_Timeline.png

**High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread: Credit Risk Barometer**

Tracks the spread investors demand to hold junk bonds versus Treasuries. Rising OAS means credit markets are pricing higher default risk. We care because HY spreads are a real-time fear gauge for recession risk—they spike before recessions as companies struggle to refinance. Current levels show moderate stress but below crisis thresholds. Watch for spreads >500bp as a red flag for credit deterioration and potential recession.

---

### 17_VIX_Timeline.png

**VIX (CBOE Volatility Index): Equity Fear Gauge**

Tracks implied volatility on S&P 500 options—the market's expectation of 30-day forward volatility. VIX >20 signals elevated fear, >30 signals panic. We care because VIX spikes precede or confirm major drawdowns. Low VIX environments (like now) indicate complacency, creating risk of sudden volatility shocks. VIX is mean-reverting: prolonged low readings typically end with abrupt spikes when macro surprises hit.

---

### 18_Unemployment_Rate.png

**U.S. Unemployment Rate: The Lagging Labor Indicator**

The unemployment rate rises during recessions but is a lagging indicator—it confirms weakness rather than forecasting it. We care because unemployment is "sticky downward"—once it starts rising, it typically continues for quarters (Sahm Rule: 0.5pp rise triggers recession signal). This chart provides context for LFI and LDI, which are leading indicators. Use unemployment to confirm labor deterioration already signaled by fragility and dynamism indices.

---

### 19_Job_Openings.png

**JOLTS Job Openings: Labor Demand Signal**

Tracks the number of unfilled job positions. Declining openings signal weakening labor demand before layoffs occur. We care because job openings are a leading indicator of unemployment—companies stop posting jobs before firing workers. The openings-to-unemployed ratio (Beveridge Curve) helps gauge labor market tightness. Watch for sustained declines in openings as a precursor to rising unemployment and consumer spending weakness.

---

### 20_Fed_Funds_Rate.png

**Federal Funds Rate: Monetary Policy Stance**

The Fed's target policy rate. Rising rates tighten financial conditions, slowing growth and inflation. We care because the Fed Funds rate determines the entire yield curve's anchor—it affects mortgage rates, corporate borrowing costs, and asset valuations. Current rate levels and forward guidance signal the Fed's growth and inflation outlook. Inverted curves (short rates > long rates) historically precede recessions as the Fed overtightens.

---

### 21_Credit_Growth_YoY.png

**Total Credit Growth (YoY): Financial System Pulse**

Year-over-year growth in total credit outstanding (household + corporate). Slowing credit growth signals tightening financial conditions and reduced spending. We care because credit fuels economic activity—declining credit growth preceded every recession. When credit contracts, consumption and investment fall, triggering recession. This chart provides early warning of credit-driven slowdowns before they appear in GDP.

---

### 22_Payrolls_YoY.png

**Nonfarm Payrolls (YoY Growth): Employment Momentum**

Year-over-year change in nonfarm payroll employment. Decelerating payroll growth signals labor market cooling. We care because payrolls drive consumer income and spending—the largest GDP component. Negative YoY growth always coincides with recession. This chart shows employment momentum, helping identify inflection points before they appear in the unemployment rate. Watch for YoY deceleration to turn negative as recession confirmation.

---

### 23_Hours_YoY.png

**Total Hours Worked (YoY Growth): Labor Intensity Signal**

Year-over-year change in aggregate hours worked. Falls faster than payrolls during slowdowns as companies cut hours before layoffs. We care because hours are a leading indicator of employment—negative hours growth typically precedes negative payroll growth by 1-2 quarters. This metric captures labor intensity and provides earlier recession warnings than headcount measures.

---

### 24_Hours_Employment_Divergence.png

**Hours Worked vs Employment Divergence: Advanced Layoff Warning**

Combines hours and employment into a single divergence view. When hours fall while employment holds, layoffs are imminent. We care because this divergence pattern has predicted every recession—companies cut hours first to preserve optionality, then fire workers when demand doesn't recover. This is one of the highest conviction recession precursors in our toolkit.

---

### 25_Yield_Curve_10Y2Y.png

**10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury Yield Spread: Recession Predictor**

The yield curve slope. When long rates fall below short rates (inversion <0), recession typically follows within 12-18 months. We care because yield curve inversions have preceded 8 of the last 8 recessions. Inversions signal bond markets expect Fed rate cuts due to coming economic weakness. The curve recently un-inverted—historically, recessions begin shortly after curves steepen post-inversion.

---

## SECTION II: GLOBAL MACRO INTELLIGENCE (MacroMicro Charts)

### mm-chart-2025-11-21_US LEIs vs. S&P 500 YoY%

**Leading Economic Indicators Diverging from Equities**

Conference Board LEI declining 6 consecutive months while S&P 500 near all-time highs—a dangerous divergence. LEI components (building permits, consumer expectations, ISM new orders) are all weakening. We care because LEI has predicted 8 of 8 recessions with 6-9 month lead time. Equity markets ignoring forward indicators creates asymmetric risk: markets typically "catch down" to LEI, not vice versa. This divergence is historically unsustainable.

---

### mm-chart-2025-11-21_Global Semi Equip Billings vs. Taiwan Exports

**AI/Chip Cycle Health Check**

Semiconductor equipment billings at record highs alongside surging Taiwan exports (TSMC/supply chain). Shows the AI infrastructure buildout remains robust. We care because equipment orders today = production 6-12 months forward. This is a forward indicator for AI capex sustainability. Any deceleration in billings would signal hyperscaler spending pause, threatening the AI secular bull case. Current strength supports NVDA/ASML/TSM valuations.

---

### mm-chart-2025-11-21_US - Contribution of IT Investment to Change in Real GDP

**Tech Capex Supporting Growth**

IT investment contributing ~0.5 percentage points to GDP growth—material support to the economy. Driven by AI infrastructure: data centers, GPU purchases, cloud buildouts. We care because this IT contribution is a key growth offset to consumer weakness. If hyperscaler capex slows, IT's GDP contribution would decline sharply, removing a critical growth pillar. This chart justifies why tech capex matters macro-economically, not just for NVDA shareholders.

---

### mm-chart-2025-11-21_US - Share of Companies Currently or Planning to Use AI

**AI Adoption Accelerating**

55% of companies using or planning AI deployment—adoption curve still early, far from saturation. We care because this justifies sustained AI capex: if enterprises are genuinely adopting AI (not just hype), infrastructure demand has years to run. AI users report 10-15% efficiency gains on average, supporting margin expansion narratives. This chart validates the secular AI bull thesis against "bubble" concerns.

---

### mm-chart-2025-11-21_Bitcoin - Average Mining Costs

**Bitcoin Mining Economics Tightening**

Mining profitability compressed—margins thin when BTC price approaches mining cost. We care because sustained trading below mining costs triggers miner capitulation: forced selling of BTC holdings creates supply pressure and historically marks bottoms. If BTC falls below $35-40K (estimated cash cost), expect miner bankruptcies and hash rate declines. This chart identifies crypto market clearing levels.

---

### mm-chart-2025-11-21_World - Net AI Talent Migration per 10,000 LinkedIn Members

**U.S. Winning the AI Talent War**

U.S. attracting AI researchers/engineers at accelerating rate while China experiences reverse brain drain. We care because talent concentration = innovation advantage via network effects. Talent flows are slow-moving but highly predictive of innovation output 2-3 years forward. This chart supports U.S. AI leadership sustainability and justifies premium valuations for U.S. AI companies over foreign competitors.

---

### MMxLHM: Number of AI-Related Patents Granted (% of World Total)

**U.S. AI Innovation Leadership**

U.S. accounts for 45% of global AI patents, China at 30% and rising. We care because patents proxy innovation output—commercial products follow 2-3 years later. U.S. patents tend to be higher-impact (more citations), reflecting quality over quantity. This chart validates U.S. AI ecosystem strength and supports long-term competitiveness. China closing gap but still trailing in both quantity and quality.

---

## SECTION III: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (TradingView Charts)

### NVDA_2025-11-22_02-17-21.png

**NVIDIA: AI Semiconductor Leader**

NVDA holds 80%+ share of AI GPU market with monopolistic pricing power. Currently trading at 50-day MA support after 15% pullback from ATH—healthy consolidation. Forward P/E 30x vs 40% growth rate = PEG <1, still attractive for growth. We care because NVDA is the purest AI infrastructure play—any weakness here signals broader AI capex concerns. Technical setup: support at $120, resistance at $145. Catalyst risk: China export restrictions, hyperscaler capex slowdown.

---

### ASML_2025-11-22_02-17-37.png

**ASML: EUV Lithography Monopoly**

ASML is the only supplier of EUV chip-making tools—essential for <5nm AI chips. $40B+ order backlog provides 2+ years revenue visibility. We care because ASML is a leading indicator for semiconductor capex—orders today = production ramp 18-24 months forward. Geographic risk: 50% revenue from China, export control tightening is headwind. Technical: broke below 200-day MA, needs to reclaim $900 to resume uptrend. Watch for order cancellations from China.

---

### TSM_2025-11-22_02-18-09.png

**Taiwan Semiconductor: Foundry Market Leader**

TSM has 60% global chip manufacturing share—irreplaceable in AI supply chain. Exclusive manufacturer of NVIDIA's H100/H200 GPUs, driving 30% YoY revenue growth. We care because TSM is the physical bottleneck for AI chip production—any capacity constraints here limit entire AI ecosystem. Geopolitical risk: Taiwan Strait tensions create risk premium in valuation. Technical: strong uptrend intact, near ATH. Risk: U.S. fab diversification could pressure margins long-term.

---

### MSFT_2025-11-22_02-28-11.png

**Microsoft: AI Monetization Leader**

Azure AI revenue growing 100%+ YoY—clearest AI revenue beneficiary in mega-cap tech. Copilot adoption at 1M+ paid users ($30/user/month = $360M annual run rate). We care because MSFT proves AI can drive revenue, not just hype. Cloud + Office 365 subscription base provides downside support—defensive quality with AI upside optionality. Technical: consolidating $400-$430 range, breakout >$430 targets $475. Valuation: 30x forward earnings for 12% growth + AI optionality = fair.

---

### JPM_2025-11-22_02-26-31.png

**JPMorgan Chase: Bank Bellwether and Credit Cycle Proxy**

Largest U.S. bank—credit quality reflects economic health. Net interest income peaked Q2 2024, margin compression as Fed cuts. We care because JPM charge-offs are an early warning system for broader credit deterioration. If credit quality weakens here, recession risk rises across economy. Technical: trading at 1.8x tangible book, reasonable for quality. Watch credit metrics: rising charge-offs would confirm recession fears.

---

### GS_2025-11-22_02-26-13.png

**Goldman Sachs: Investment Banking Recovery Play**

GS is levered to capital markets activity—M&A/IPO rebound after 2-year drought. Trading revenue (FICC/Equities) strong as volatility benefits revenue. We care because GS profits proxy risk appetite: when M&A recovers, it signals CEO confidence returning. Valuation: 1.5x tangible book = premium to peers, justified by superior ROTCE. Technical: breaking out of 18-month base, target $525 on IB recovery. Risk: if M&A stalls again, GS underperforms.

---

### COIN_2025-11-22_02-21-42.png

**Coinbase: Crypto Exchange Leader**

Dominant U.S. crypto platform benefiting from spot ETF flows and institutional adoption. 80% revenue transaction-based—highly correlated to crypto volatility and volumes. We care because COIN is the purest regulated crypto exposure for institutional portfolios. Regulatory risk: SEC lawsuit ongoing = binary outcome risk. Technical: extremely volatile, support at $150, resistance at $300. Trade using options for asymmetric exposure vs outright stock.

---

### MSTR_2025-11-22_02-24-02.png

**MicroStrategy: Leveraged Bitcoin Treasury Play**

MSTR holds 150K+ BTC on balance sheet—pure leveraged BTC exposure. Stock trades at 2.5x BTC holdings (premium to NAV) reflecting convertible debt optionality. We care because MSTR = levered BTC call option with credit risk. Volatility is 2x beta to Bitcoin—for aggressive BTC bulls only. Funding risk: uses convertible debt to buy BTC, refinancing risk if BTC crashes. This is a speculation vehicle, not a core holding.

---

### MARA_2025-11-22_02-25-28.png

**Marathon Digital: Bitcoin Mining Exposure**

MARA profitability depends on BTC >$35K (estimated cash cost). Expanding hash rate capacity 50% in 2025—dilutive but scales operations. We care because miners are leveraged BTC plays with operational risk. High beta to BTC price magnifies gains and losses. Technical: volatile, better to use options than stock for directional bets. Risk: sustained BTC weakness = bankruptcy risk for levered miners. Watch mining cost chart for capitulation signals.

---

### HYG_2025-11-22_02-29-52.png

**iShares High Yield Bond ETF: Credit Market Sentiment Gauge**

HYG tracks high-yield corporate bond index—rallies when spreads tighten, falls when spreads widen. Currently near 52-week highs despite macro risks—potential credit complacency. We care because HYG is a liquid proxy for credit risk appetite. In recessions, HYG falls 20-30%, making it useful for portfolio protection via puts. Watch for HYG breakdown below $78 as credit stress confirmation. Current levels suggest credit markets are sanguine about recession risk.

---

### MRI_Macro_Risk_Index_components.png

**MRI Component Breakdown: Stacked Drivers of Systemic Risk**

Decomposes MRI into its six component contributions over time: LFI (labor fragility), -LDI (labor dynamism inverted), YFS (funding stress), HY OAS (credit risk), EMD (equity momentum), and -LCI (liquidity cushion inverted). Shows which drivers contribute to composite risk at any point. We care because this identifies whether risk is broad-based (all components elevated) or isolated (one dominant driver). Current state: LCI is primary risk driver, partially offset by benign labor dynamism and moderate equity momentum. Helps forecast whether risk is likely to escalate or stabilize.
