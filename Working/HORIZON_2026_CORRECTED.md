## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The S&P 500 reached new highs in 2025 while the quits rate collapsed to 1.9%—the lowest since 2018. GDP printed 2.1% while Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers lagged by 80 basis points. The yield curve inverted for 487 consecutive days, then uninverted in November as the Fed pivoted to "Reserve Management Purchases."

The consensus called this a soft landing.

The data says something different.

On December 1, 2025, the Federal Reserve ended quantitative tightening for Treasury securities. The Overnight Reverse Repo facility now holds **$3.05 billion**—down from $2.556 trillion at peak. That's a 99.88% drawdown over 35 months. The liquidity buffer that absorbed $5 trillion of pandemic-era monetary stimulus has vanished precisely when Treasury issuance is running at $2.1 trillion annually and foreign demand is declining.

The Fed's December announcement of Reserve Management Purchases ($40 billion per month in T-bill acquisitions) isn't monetary easing. It's an acknowledgment that the financial system's plumbing requires active intervention to prevent dysfunction. And the plumbing stress that triggered the policy pivot? It's temporarily eased—SOFR-IORB has normalized to +2 bps (down from +8-12 bps October spikes). The RMP intervention worked. For now.

This report examines the macro transmission mechanism across three pillars: **Macro Dynamics** (fundamental economic activity), **Monetary Mechanics** (liquidity plumbing and credit transmission), and **Market Technicals** (positioning, structure, and volatility regimes).

The synthesis reveals a critical divergence: liquidity conditions are improving tactically (RMPs, rate cuts) while structural fundamentals are deteriorating (labor flows weakening, credit impulse fading, market breadth compressing).

**The framework predicts:** Liquidity dominates Q1 2026, creating conditions for a reflationary grind as RMP injections overpower macro headwinds. By mid-year, fundamental constraints reassert as the weight of fiscal supply forces term premium normalization.

**Probability distribution:**
- **55% Base Case:** Q1 rally, Q2-Q4 repricing—soft landing achieved with correction
- **30% Plumbing Accident:** Acute liquidity stress, 22-28% drawdown, 9-12 month recovery
- **15% Hard Landing:** Recession confirmation, 28-35% decline, 18-24 month recovery

**The positioning implications:** Capture Q1 liquidity, reduce beta by Q2, maintain convexity through gold and volatility hedges. Watch RRP levels, SOFR-IORB spreads, dealer auction takedowns, and initial claims. The plumbing signals before the headlines confirm.

# I. MACRO DYNAMICS: THE FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE

## 1.1 Labor Markets: Flow Analysis and Leading Indicators

Unemployment stands at 4.2% as of November 2025. Payrolls added 150,000 in the most recent month. Headlines suggest stability.

The flow data tells a different story.

### The Sahm Rule Proximity

The Sahm Rule—measuring the three-month moving average of unemployment relative to its 12-month low—currently reads 0.35 percentage points. The recession threshold sits at 0.50. We're 15 basis points from a signal that has predicted every recession since 1970 without generating a single false positive.

I wasn't consulted on the threshold. The data doesn't care.

The rule's predictive power derives from labor market hysteresis: once unemployment begins rising, feedback mechanisms accelerate deterioration. Workers laid off reduce consumption, forcing additional layoffs. Credit tightens as default risk rises. The transition from "gradual softening" to "self-reinforcing contraction" typically occurs within 3-4 months of crossing the threshold.

### Quits Rate: The Confidence Barometer

The quits rate measures voluntary job separations as a percentage of employment. When workers are confident, they quit to pursue better positions. When confidence deteriorates, they hunker down.

October 2025: **1.9%** of employees quit voluntarily. This is the lowest reading since January 2015, excluding pandemic months.

For context: the quits rate peaked at 3.0% in April 2022 during the "Great Resignation." The current 1.9% reading represents a **37% decline from peak**—the largest non-recession drop in series history.

Workers aren't quitting because they don't see better options. That's not complacency. That's fragility.

### Our Labor Fragility Index

Our proprietary **Labor Fragility Index (LFI)** synthesizes multiple labor flow indicators to identify structural weakness before headline unemployment rises. It tracks the deterioration in worker confidence, hiring momentum, and duration dynamics that precede recessions.

**Current LFI: -0.63σ** (as of September 2025)

This reading indicates the labor market is technically healthy but deteriorating at the margin. The quits rate decline and rising long-term unemployment duration are flashing yellow, even as headline figures remain strong.

**LFI Interpretation:**
- Below -1.0σ: Healthy, dynamic labor market
- -1.0σ to 0.0: Softening, monitoring required
- 0.0 to +1.0σ: Fragility developing, reduce cyclical exposure
- Above +1.0σ: Severe stress, recession risk elevated

The current reading suggests we're in "late cycle but not breaking" territory—frozen, not crashing. Companies are hoarding labor (layoffs remain historically low at 1.2%) because 2021-2022 hiring difficulties remain fresh in corporate memory. But they're not adding headcount either.

This configuration can persist for quarters. Historical precedent: late 1989, late 2000, late 2007 all exhibited similar patterns that lasted 4-8 quarters before breaking.

**The critical observation:** When the freeze breaks, it typically transitions to mass layoffs abruptly rather than gradually.

## 1.2 Inflation Architecture: The Goods-Services Bifurcation

Core PCE stands at 2.8% year-over-year as of October 2025. That's 80 basis points above the Fed's 2.0% target despite 18 months of restrictive policy.

The composition reveals why the final descent to 2.0% has proven elusive.

### Goods Disinflation: Mission Accomplished

Durable goods prices have declined 3.2% year-over-year. Non-durable goods inflation runs at 0.8%. The goods sector has achieved full disinflation:
- Used vehicles: -5.8% YoY
- Apparel: -2.1% YoY
- Consumer electronics: -4.3% YoY

Supply chains have normalized. Container shipping rates are at $2,400 (vs. $20,000 at peak). China's exporting deflation at -2.9% PPI. The goods inflation problem is solved.

### Services Inflation: The Persistent Challenge

Services inflation runs at **3.8%** year-over-year—the "supercore" that excludes both goods and housing. This is the Fed's true concern.

The stickiness reflects structural forces:
- **Wage Pass-Through:** Service sector compensation grew 4.6% over the past year—well above the 2.5-3.0% pace consistent with 2% inflation
- **Housing Lag:** Market rents have moderated, but CPI shelter remains at 4.8% due to the 12-18 month lease renewal lag
- **Insurance/Interest Costs:** Higher rates increased costs for insurers and financial services, now passing through to consumers

### The Fed's Implicit Trade-Off

On December 18, 2025, the Federal Reserve cut rates 25 basis points despite Core PCE at 2.8% and services inflation at 3.8%.

Powell's commentary was telling: *"The path to 2% may take longer than initially expected"* and *"We're seeing a more sustainable pace of job growth."*

Translation: The Fed is accepting 2.5-2.8% inflation to preserve labor market stability and prevent plumbing stress. This is the implicit trade-off of the current regime.

**Inflation trajectory projection:**
- Q1 2026: 2.7% (housing disinflation offset by services stickiness)
- Q2 2026: 2.6%
- Q3-Q4 2026: 2.5-2.8% range (stalling as housing tailwind fades)

The 2.0% target may need to become the 2.5% reality.

---

## 1.3 Growth Dynamics: Composition and Sustainability

Real GDP averaged 2.1% over the past four quarters. Atlanta Fed's GDPNow estimates Q4 2025 at 2.8%. Headline resilience.

Decompose the growth and the fragility appears.

### GDP vs. Final Sales: The Divergence

Q3 2025 data:
- Real GDP: +2.8% annualized
- Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers: +1.3% annualized

The 1.5 percentage point gap represents the largest sustained divergence since Q4 2008. The gap is driven by:
1. **Inventory Accumulation:** Businesses added $130 billion in inventories (contributing +0.9pp to GDP)—involuntary stockpiling, not anticipatory building
2. **Government Spending:** Federal/state/local added +0.5pp to GDP

When inventory accumulation is involuntary (indicated by rising inventory-to-sales ratios at 1.48 vs. 1.42 pre-pandemic), it portends future production cuts.

### Consumption: Credit-Fueled, Not Income-Driven

Personal consumption grew 3.7% annualized in Q3. But real disposable income grew just 1.9%. The delta was filled by credit:
- Credit card balances: +5.7% YoY to $1.23 trillion
- Savings rate: 4.4% (half the 8.9% historical average)
- "Excess savings" buffer: Fully depleted for bottom 80% since Q1 2023

Credit quality is deteriorating:
- Credit card delinquencies (90+ days): 7.05% (highest since 2011)
- Auto loan delinquencies: 7.3%
- Student loans: 9.4% following resumption of payment reporting

The geographical distribution matters: ZIP codes in the bottom income quartile show 10.2% credit card delinquency rates vs. 4.1% in top quartile areas. This is a two-speed consumer economy.

### The AI Capex Mirage

Business fixed investment grew 7.3% annualized in Q3—seemingly robust.

But intellectual property investment (software, data centers) grew at 198% annualized. Exclude that? Business fixed investment grew just **1.2%**. Structures investment declined 2.8%.

The AI Arms Race is real—Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta are collectively investing $180 billion annually. But it represents a narrow growth driver that hasn't yet generated broad-based economic acceleration. Manufacturing PMI has been below 50 for 14 consecutive months.

# II. MONETARY MECHANICS: PLUMBING ARCHITECTURE

The Fed's balance sheet, reserve management framework, and repo market plumbing represent the mechanical substrate through which monetary policy transmits to financial conditions. While consensus focuses on the fed funds rate, the decisive factors for 2026 lie in the operational mechanics.

## 2.1 The RRP Exhaustion: Quantifying the Liquidity Drain

The Overnight Reverse Repo facility served as the Federal Reserve's operational floor for short-term rates and, during 2021-2024, functioned as the primary shock absorber for excess reserves.

### The Arithmetic of Depletion

- **Peak level (December 30, 2022):** $2,556 billion
- **Current level (December 19, 2025):** $3.05 billion
- **Total drawdown:** $2,553 billion (99.88%)
- **Duration:** 36 months

The facility is functionally exhausted. The remaining balance represents structural operational minimums (GSE daily liquidity management) that cannot be further reduced.

### What the RRP Absorbed

During 2020-2021, the Fed's emergency response expanded the balance sheet by $4.8 trillion. The RRP facility provided the release valve: it allowed excess reserves to be converted into overnight reverse repos that didn't count against bank balance sheet constraints.

From 2021-2022, the RRP effectively absorbed the excess liquidity created by QE without creating financial market distortions. It prevented T-bill yields from going negative, excess reserve accumulation that would have forced banks to turn away deposits, and disorderly repricing as fiscal stimulus injected unprecedented cash.

The RRP's $2.5 trillion peak represented the maximum liquidity buffer—the amount of excess reserves that could be drained before creating stress.

### Current State: The Buffer Is Gone

With RRP effectively at zero, the system has lost its liquidity shock absorber. Every fluctuation in the Treasury General Account, every large auction settlement, every quarter-end regulatory reporting date now impacts bank reserves directly rather than being absorbed by the RRP buffer.

The September 2019 repo crisis provides precedent. At that time, RRP stood at just $8 billion (similar to today), and a combination of tax payments and auction settlement caused overnight repo rates to spike from 2.00% to 10.00% in a single day.

The November-December 2025 conditions replicate the structural setup—with the added complexity of much higher total debt outstanding and larger deficits requiring greater issuance.

---

## 2.2 Reserve Management Purchases: The Fed's Response

On December 10, 2025, the Fed announced $40 billion per month in Treasury bill purchases beginning December 12. The NY Fed specified that RMP pace "will remain elevated for a few months" to offset large increases in non-reserve liabilities around April 2026 tax dates, after which purchases "will likely be significantly reduced."

Chair Powell emphasized this represents a "technical" operation for money market functioning rather than stimulus.

Here's what actually matters.

### The Combined Monthly Impact

- Bill RMPs: $40 billion
- MBS reinvestment: $20-25 billion
- **Total monthly purchases: $60-65 billion**

Over twelve months, this represents $720-780 billion in balance sheet expansion—equivalent to roughly 45% of pandemic-era QE monthly pace at peak.

### QE vs. RMP: Why the Distinction Matters (and Doesn't)

The Fed's argument: RMPs purchase bills (short duration) for reserve management rather than bonds (long duration) for yield curve control.

Why markets don't care: When the Fed buys $40 billion of T-bills, $40 billion of cash enters the system. Whether that cash came from buying bills for "operational purposes" or bonds for "policy purposes" is irrelevant to the entity receiving the cash.

Historical precedent: September 2019 "not-QE." The Fed initiated bill purchases explicitly labeled "not QE" for the same operational reasons. Market response: S&P 500 rallied 12% over the subsequent four months. Balance sheet expansion supported risk assets regardless of Fed communication.

### The Key Development: Stress Has Eased (For Now)

Here's what changed between October and December 2025:

The RMP intervention worked. SOFR-IORB spread has normalized to **+2 bps** (down from +8-12 bps October spikes). The funding stress that triggered the policy pivot has temporarily eased.

But "temporarily" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. The structural vulnerabilities remain: RRP at zero, dealer balance sheets constrained, foreign demand declining, fiscal issuance relentless.

---

## 2.3 Repo Market Mechanics: Current State Assessment

### SOFR vs. IORB: The Inversion Signal (And Its Resolution)

Two key overnight rates matter:
- **SOFR:** Rate at which cash is lent against Treasury collateral. Currently: 4.57%
- **IORB:** Rate the Fed pays banks to hold reserves. Currently: 4.55%

**Current spread: +2 bps**

This is near-normal functioning. When SOFR trades above IORB, it signals broken markets. The October spikes to +8-12 bps indicated stress. The current +2 bps suggests the RMP intervention has succeeded in stabilizing funding conditions.

But the monitoring continues. A return above +8 bps would signal renewed stress.

### Dealer Balance Sheet Capacity

Primary dealers serve as intermediaries between the Treasury and end investors. Basel III's Supplementary Leverage Ratio requires banks to hold Tier 1 capital equal to 3-5% of total assets—and a $100M Treasury position requires the same capital as a $100M corporate loan, despite Treasuries carrying zero credit risk.

Estimated total dealer capacity: $100-120 billion. Current dealer inventory: ~$95 billion. Utilization: 80-95%.

The system relies on dealers holding just 0.15 days of daily trading volume as buffer inventory.

### Our Liquidity Cushion Index

Our proprietary **Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI)** tracks the system's ability to absorb shocks by measuring the depth of available liquidity buffers relative to economic activity.

**Current LCI: -0.91σ** (Q1 2025)

**LCI Interpretation:**
- Above 0.0: Ample liquidity, system can absorb shocks
- 0.0 to -0.5: Tightening, reduced shock absorption
- -0.5 to -1.0: Thin buffer, funding stress risk elevated
- Below -1.0: Scarce liquidity, crisis risk high

The current reading indicates we're operating with thin liquidity buffers—not crisis territory, but minimal margin for error. Any combination of TGA volatility, heavy auction settlement, and quarter-end pressures creates risk of funding stress.

---

## 2.4 The Stablecoin-Treasury Nexus

Stablecoins have evolved from niche crypto infrastructure to systemically important participants in U.S. Treasury markets.

**Total stablecoin market cap:** ~$256 billion
- **Tether (USDT):** $176 billion, holds ~$120 billion in Treasuries/repo
- **Circle (USDC):** $64 billion, holds ~$52 billion in Treasuries

**Combined Treasury holdings:** ~$172 billion

This makes stablecoin issuers collectively larger Treasury holders than Germany ($118B), South Korea ($114B), or Australia ($63B).

The systemic concern: What happens during crypto market stress? If Bitcoin crashes 40%, triggering 20% stablecoin redemptions:
- Total redemptions: ~$51 billion
- Required Treasury liquidations: ~$48 billion over 2-4 weeks

In baseline conditions, dealers absorb this, bill yields rise 10-15bps temporarily. In stress conditions—when redemptions coincide with quarter-end and heavy issuance—the liquidation overwhelms dealer capacity.

The Fed's RMP announcement creates an implicit backstop. If stablecoin redemptions force large T-bill liquidations, the Fed steps in via RMP purchases. Crypto market volatility now transmits directly to Fed balance sheet policy.

Welcome to the new interconnected plumbing.

# III. MARKET TECHNICALS: POSITIONING AND STRUCTURE

## 3.1 Positioning Architecture: Quantifying Crowding

### CTA Systematic Positioning

Commodity Trading Advisors manage approximately $400 billion globally, with 30-35% allocated to equity index futures. These strategies employ algorithmic position sizing based on volatility-adjusted trend signals.

**Current positioning:**
- Global Equity Long Exposure: $116 billion notional (75th-79th percentile historically)
- Leverage Ratio: 2.8x gross leverage to NAV (elevated but below 3.2x peaks)

The positioning mechanics create asymmetric risk:
- **Low Volatility:** CTAs increase leverage mechanically → buying pressure → further volatility suppression (self-reinforcing)
- **Volatility Spike:** Risk models trigger position reduction → systematic selling → further volatility expansion (self-reinforcing)

CTA positioning is currently elevated while realized volatility is compressed to the 15th percentile of the past decade. This configuration has preceded every major drawdown since 2010.

### Risk Parity Exposure

Risk parity funds allocate capital based on each asset class's contribution to portfolio volatility. These strategies collectively manage $300-400 billion.

Current estimated equity allocation: 38% (vs. 25-30% in higher volatility periods). This represents $115-150 billion in equity exposure that is volatility-targeted rather than fundamentally driven.

If spot VIX rises from current 16.87 to 28, volatility control strategies would need to reduce equity exposure by approximately 35-40%. Applied to current exposure, this represents $40-60B of mechanical selling pressure.

### The Crowding Synthesis

Everyone is positioned for the same outcome: continued market strength supported by Fed liquidity. CTAs max long, risk parity levered up, hedge funds net long at elevated levels, retail piling in.

This crowding creates fragility. The catalyst doesn't need to be large—merely sufficient to trigger systematic de-leveraging cascades.

---

## 3.2 Credit Markets: The Repricing Story

### Current Spread Levels

- **HY OAS:** 295 bps (December 18, 2025)
- **IG OAS:** 87 bps
- **10Y-2Y Spread:** +66 bps (curve has bear steepened)

### Our Credit-Labor Gap

Our proprietary **Credit-Labor Gap (CLG)** identifies when credit markets are ignoring labor market reality. It measures the divergence between credit spread pricing and labor market stress signals.

**Current CLG: +0.16σ**

**CLG Interpretation:**
- Above +1.0σ: Credit too tight vs. labor reality (spreads ignore weakness)—bearish for credit
- -1.0σ to +1.0σ: Markets aligned with fundamentals
- Below -1.0σ: Credit too wide vs. labor (overshooting)—potential bargains

Here's the key development: The CLG has shifted from negative (credit ignoring labor weakness) to near-neutral. **This removes one of our primary bearish arguments for near-term spread widening.**

What happened? Credit markets corrected their earlier complacency. HY spreads widened from 265 bps (September) to 295 bps (December) while labor indicators stabilized. The market repriced to match reality.

This is constructive near-term. It doesn't eliminate structural vulnerabilities, but it removes the immediate catalyst for spread blowout.

---

## 3.3 Market Breadth: The Concentration Problem

### Cap-Weighted vs. Equal-Weighted Performance

- **S&P 500 Cap-Weighted (SPY):** +23.4% YTD
- **S&P 500 Equal-Weighted (RSP):** +11.1% YTD
- **Divergence:** 12.3 percentage points (95th percentile since 1990)

### Magnificent 7 Dominance

The Mag 7 represent ~32% of S&P 500 market cap (up from 24% in 2023).

- **Mag 7 Average Return YTD:** +48.6%
- **S&P 493 (ex-Mag 7) YTD:** +8.7%
- **Contribution to SPX Return:** Mag 7 contributed +15.6pp of the SPX's +23.4pp return

**65% of S&P 500 gains came from 1.4% of constituents.**

### Drawdown Distribution Reality

While headline SPX is 2.1% off all-time highs:
- Median SPX stock: -18.7% from 52-week high
- 41% of constituents: >20% decline from 52-week high
- 18% of constituents: >30% decline from 52-week high

The index mask is hiding significant underlying weakness.

### Advance-Decline Divergence

- SPX Price (December 2025): New all-time high
- Cumulative A/D Line: 8.3% below July 2024 peak

This negative divergence has preceded corrections in 73% of historical instances since 1980.

---

# IV. CROSS-ASSET POSITIONING FRAMEWORK

## 4.1 Fixed Income: Term Premium Normalization

### The Base Case: Bear Steepening

Current levels (December 18, 2025):
- 2-Year Treasury: 4.25%
- 10-Year Treasury: 4.52%
- 30-Year Treasury: 4.70%
- 10Y-2Y Spread: +66 bps (steepened significantly)

Term premium currently sits at ~0.74%—low relative to fiscal fundamentals. Given Debt/GDP at 123.8%, Deficit/GDP at 6.2%, and declining foreign holdings share, term premium should normalize toward 1.20-1.50%.

**Scenario A: Gradual Normalization (55% probability)**
- 10Y yield rises to 4.85-5.00%
- 2Y declines to 3.85-3.95% on Fed cuts
- 2s10s steepens to +105 bps

**Scenario B: Accelerated Repricing (25% probability)**
- 10Y yield spikes to 5.50%
- Auction stress or foreign selling acceleration
- TLT: -20% or worse

**Scenario C: Recession (15% probability)**
- 10Y declines to 3.20-3.50%
- 2Y plunges to 2.50%
- Bull steepening as Fed cuts aggressively

### Positioning Implementation

**Barbell Structure:**
- Overweight front end (2Y): Benefits from Fed cuts in all scenarios
- Underweight long end (10Y+): Vulnerable in Scenarios A and B (75% combined probability)
- Neutral belly (5Y-7Y): Balanced exposure

---

## 4.2 Equities: Quality and Defense

### Valuation Starting Point

- Forward P/E: 22.4x (vs. 10Y average 18.7x)
- Shiller CAPE: 40.1 (vs. historical median 17.2)

All major valuation metrics sit in the 85th-95th percentile. The starting point creates mechanical repricing risk if yields rise.

### Our Master Risk Framework

Our proprietary **Macro Risk Index (MRI)** synthesizes labor fragility, liquidity conditions, credit stress, and market momentum divergence into a single regime signal.

**Current MRI: -0.33σ**

**MRI Interpretation:**
- Below 0.0: Low risk environment, overweight equities (65-70%)
- 0.0 to +0.5: Neutral, strategic allocation (55-60%)
- +0.5 to +1.0: Elevated risk, reduce beta (45-50%)
- +1.0 to +1.5: High risk, defensive positioning (30-40%)
- Above +1.5: Extreme risk, crisis hedges (20-30%)

The current reading suggests cautious optimism—not crisis territory, but not all-clear either. The negative reading reflects improved credit conditions (CLG normalization) and stabilized funding (SOFR-IORB normalization), offset by labor fragility concerns and stretched positioning.

### Sector and Style Positioning

**Overweight:**
- Technology (Semiconductors): AI infrastructure build has multi-year visibility
- Healthcare: Defensive with non-cyclical revenue
- Utilities: Bond proxy with 3.5-4.0% yields

**Underweight:**
- Consumer Discretionary: Exposed to leveraged lower-income consumer
- Real Estate: Highest duration sensitivity among sectors
- Energy: Lack of catalyst with oil range-bound $60-75

---

## 4.3 Commodities: Gold as Fiscal Hedge

### Gold: The Structural Trade

Gold reached $4,250/oz in December 2025 despite rising real yields. The traditional relationship has broken down since 2022.

The regime shift: Gold is pricing as a **fiscal hedge** rather than pure inflation hedge. Central bank purchases (1,000+ tons annually since 2022) from price-insensitive buyers (China, emerging markets diversifying from dollars) create structural demand.

**Target:** $4,500-4,800/oz over 6-12 months (+6% to +13%)

**Portfolio allocation:** 5-7% (vs. typical 0-3%)

---

# V. SCENARIO FRAMEWORK

## Scenario A: Reflationary Grind → Mid-Year Repricing (55% Base Case)

**Q1 2026 Dynamics:**
- RMPs stabilize repo markets
- SOFR-IORB stays below +5 bps
- SPX grinds toward 7,200
- HY spreads remain range-bound 285-315 bps

**Q2-Q4 2026 Dynamics:**
- Heavy refunding tests dealer capacity
- Foreign TIC data confirms continued selling
- RMPs taper, repricing initiates
- SPX corrects 12-18%, HY widens to 450-520 bps

**Outcome:** Soft landing achieved but with 12-18% equity correction and term premium normalization.

## Scenario B: Plumbing Accident (30% Risk Case)

**Trigger:** RMPs insufficient, major auction fails, stablecoin run forces T-bill liquidation

**Transmission:**
- SOFR-IORB spikes to +18 bps
- SRF usage hits $85B
- VIX spikes from 17 to 42
- SPX drops 22-28% in weeks

**Recovery:** Fed emergency response stabilizes within 45 days. 9-12 month recovery to pre-crisis levels.

## Scenario C: Hard Landing (15% Tail Case)

**Trigger:** Labor hoarding breaks, initial claims spike to 320k+, consumer spending collapses

**Transmission:**
- Unemployment rises to 5.2-5.5%
- Sahm Rule triggers
- GDP contracts Q1-Q2 2026
- SPX declines 28-35%

**Recovery:** 18-24 months once recession ends.

# VII. CONCLUSION

The December 2025 macro configuration presents a paradox: improving surface data masking deteriorating structural fundamentals. The Fed's pivot to Reserve Management Purchases acknowledges the fragility. RMPs buy time, they don't solve underlying problems.

**The key developments since October:**
1. **RRP exhaustion complete:** $3.05B vs. $2.556T peak—99.88% gone
2. **Plumbing stress temporarily eased:** SOFR-IORB normalized to +2 bps from +8-12 bps
3. **Credit repriced:** CLG at +0.16σ means markets are no longer complacent
4. **Labor frozen, not breaking:** LFI at -0.63σ indicates fragility developing but not crisis

**The positioning implications:**

**Q1 2026: Capture the Liquidity**
- 45% equity exposure, tilted to quality
- Underweight long-duration Treasuries (steepener)
- 5-7% gold allocation as fiscal hedge
- Monitor SOFR-IORB for stress signals

**Q2-Q4 2026: Prepare for Repricing**
- Reduce equity beta as Q1 rally matures (target 35-40%)
- Extend duration selectively if recession signals emerge
- Maintain credit quality
- Raise cash to 15-20%

The system found temporary equilibrium through Fed intervention. The water level is still rising. The dam was reinforced in December.

Swim while you can. Know where the exits are.
