## Relationship Status

**Active advisory conversation** — not formalized yet, but strong mutual interest.

### Key Meeting (Dec 16, 2025)
From Gemini meeting notes:
- Liquidity is her #1 factor for crypto performance
- Wants help with: market direction, trading strategy, bottom-up altcoin analysis
- Requested automated alerts on liquidity triggers/milestones
- Struggling with on-chain data quality (Messari not cutting it)

### Agreed Next Steps (from meeting):
1. Bob provides weekly/monthly deep-level insights on liquidity triggers
2. Automated Telegram/email alerts when reserves hit levels or balance sheet moves
3. Connect with her CTO **Jackie** to discuss on-chain data providers
4. Intro to her brother (she's sending email)
5. Monthly follow-up calls

## First Deliverable: BCH Analysis (Dec 22, 2025)

### How It Started
- **She sent:** Lookonchain tweet about dormant wallet (possibly Erik Voorhees) swapping $13.4M ETH → 24,950 BCH
- **She asked:** "pls share your thoughts after you look at it - I would welcome any feedback"

### What Bob Delivered
- Full BCH analysis PDF combining:
  - Derivatives structure (OI by exchange, funding rates, liquidation map)
  - On-chain fundamentals (activity, concentration, usage)
  - Macro liquidity overlay (RRP, stablecoins, zero buffer caveat)
  - Trade setup (entry/target/stop, 1-2% max allocation)
- Data sources: Surf.ai for derivatives/liquidation visuals

### DM Sent (Dec 22, 7:47 AM):
> I took a deeper look at the BCH wallet activity you sent and pressure-tested it across derivatives structure and liquidity context.
>
> Net: positioning is skewed short, liquidation structure is asymmetric to the upside, and the current liquidity regime is supportive — with the caveat that there's very little buffer, so sizing matters.
>
> Attaching a short note in case it's useful. Happy to discuss or refine.

### Her Response:
> "Thanks! will take a look and revert"

### Current Status: **WAITING** — do not follow up unless she responds or BCH moves materially

## Scope Discussion (Not Yet Formalized)

Original thinking was ~$15K/month macro retainer.

**Actual scope is bigger:**
1. Macro liquidity framework ✓
2. On-chain analytics help (new scope)
3. Altcoin-level analysis (new scope — BCH was first)
4. Automated alerting system (new scope)

**Revised estimate:** $20-25K/month or embedded arrangement. Don't undersell.

## Key Dynamics

### What She Values
- Disciplined thinking, not CT parroting
- Someone who does the work on signals she flags
- Macro + derivatives + on-chain synthesis (her gap)
- Risk-aware sizing, not promotional calls

### Positioning
- Bob = "send me raw signals, get disciplined thinking back"
- Not competing with Surf.ai/Nansen — he's the synthesis layer on top
- Collaborative dynamic, not transactional

### What NOT to Do
- Don't over-follow up
- Don't re-explain signals already covered
- Don't try to "close" anything
- Don't send more materials unless asked

## On-Chain Stack Discussion

She needs cleaner on-chain data than Messari. Bob planning to add:
- **Glassnode** — BTC/ETH on-chain (paid tiers cleaner)
- **DefiLlama** — TVL, stablecoin supply, protocol-level
- **CoinMetrics** — institutional-grade, expensive
- **Artemis** — newer, cross-chain comparisons
- **Dune Analytics** — custom queries

Key metrics to systematize:
- Stablecoin flows
- Exchange reserve changes
- Whale wallet movements
- Perpetual funding rates
- Options put/call + open interest
- MVRV, SOPR, realized price bands

**Next step:** Connect with her CTO Jackie to discuss data providers

---

## Follow-Up Triggers

Only re-engage if:
1. She responds with questions or feedback
2. BCH breaks $600 and funding stays negative (one-liner: "Funding held negative through $600 — squeeze is real, not just positioning noise.")
3. She asks for analysis on another token
4. Liquidity regime changes materially
