REFLEXIVE BID THREAD - FINAL TWEETS
====================================

TWEET 1 - Chart: 01_unrealized_losses.png
-----------------------------------------
The macro herd is obsessed with "SVB 2.0" duration mismatch risk. Banks sitting on $337B in unrealized losses. What they're missing: the same regulations meant to fix this are creating a mechanical, involuntary bid for Treasuries. 🧵


TWEET 2 - Chart: 03_hqla_composition.png
-----------------------------------------
When regulators force banks to de-risk via Living Wills, SLR, and LCR, that liquidity doesn't vanish. It gets recycled into High-Quality Liquid Assets. Treasuries now make up 72% of HQLA, up from 40% in 2015. Reserves got cut in half.


TWEET 3 - Chart: 02_treasury_pct_assets.png
-----------------------------------------
The forced migration is visible in the data. Treasury holdings as a share of large bank assets: 3% in 2013 → 11% today. A 267% increase. This isn't asset allocation. It's regulatory physics.


TWEET 4 - Chart: 05_treasury_vs_dealer.png
-----------------------------------------
Meanwhile, dealer intermediation capacity has collapsed. Treasury supply up 460% since 2007. Dealer balance sheets down 45%. The involuntary holder expands while the market-maker shrinks.


TWEET 5 - Chart: 04_reflexive_loop.png
-----------------------------------------
The reflexive loop: Duration mismatch "risk" → regulatory de-risking → forced HQLA reallocation → mechanical Treasury bid → hollow rally with fragile support. The problem is becoming the solution is becoming the next problem.


TWEET 6 - No chart (or repeat 01)
-----------------------------------------
Monitor FR Y-9C filings, not just the yield curve. This structural bid supports the rally but makes it brittle. When the scaffolding fails, there's no marginal buyer behind it.
