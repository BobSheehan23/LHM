# The Reflexive Bid: Why Duration Mismatch Is Becoming the Treasury Buyer

The macro herd is obsessed with "SVB 2.0" and duration mismatch risk. Banks sitting on unrealized losses. Long-dated securities underwater. The narrative writes itself.

What they're missing: the same mismatch creating the risk is now creating a mechanical, involuntary bid for US Treasuries.

This isn't a bullish call. It's an explanation for why the hollow rally might persist longer than fundamentals suggest. And why, when it eventually breaks, the snap-back could be more violent than anticipated.

## The Problem Everyone Sees

Duration mismatch is real. When the Fed raised rates from 0% to 5.5% in record time, banks with long-duration asset portfolios got hit. Unrealized losses on securities peaked around $690B in Q3 2022. They're still sitting around $337B today.

The conventional wisdom: banks are vulnerable, they need to shed duration risk, and any shock could force asset sales at losses (SVB redux). The market is pricing this in. Or so everyone thinks.

## What They're Missing: The Plumbing

Here's where it gets interesting. Post-GFC growth didn't just migrate to shadow banks outside the regulatory perimeter. A lot of it metastasized inside bank holding companies (BHCs) via non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). These are the internal funding networks that lived in the regulatory gray zone.

Think of it this way: traditional banks grew slowly and steadily. But the real action was in the orange layer above them. Internal shadow banking structures that allowed BHCs to take on leverage and generate returns without the same capital constraints as their regulated bank subsidiaries.

Regulators noticed. And now they want it dismantled.

## Enter Living Wills and the SLR

This is where the reflexivity kicks in. When regulators force banks to de-risk these internal NBFI networks via Living Wills (resolution plans) and tighten the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), that liquidity doesn't just vanish.

It gets recycled.

Banks don't get to choose where it goes. Regulatory ratios like the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) force them into High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA). Specifically: US Treasuries.

This is the forced migration. Banks are being pushed out of credit risk and into the very asset class everyone thinks they're trying to avoid.

## The HQLA Shift: Follow the Composition

Look at what's happened to the composition of HQLA over the past decade. In 2015, Treasuries made up about 40% of banks' high-quality liquid assets. Reserves made up 45%. Agency MBS filled out the rest.

By 2024, Treasuries account for 72% of HQLA. Reserves have been cut in half to 20%. Agency MBS down to 8%. Everything is migrating into Treasuries because that's what the regulatory ratios demand.

This isn't banks making an asset allocation decision. This is regulatory physics.

## The Data: 3% to 11%

The clearest signal is in the actual holdings. Treasury securities as a percentage of large bank assets have climbed from 3% in 2013 to 11% today. That's a 267% increase.

*Figure 3: Treasury holdings as % of bank assets, 2013-2024*

The COVID spike is visible. But notice the steady climb before and after. And the acceleration since 2024 as Living Wills requirements kicked in.

While dealer intermediation capacity shrinks (more on this below), the involuntary holder expands. The duration mismatch "risk" is literally becoming the buyer of last resort.

---

## The Fragility: Supply vs Capacity

Here's where it gets concerning. Treasury supply has exploded—up 460% since 2007. Meanwhile, dealer balance sheet capacity has collapsed by 45% over the same period.

The intermediaries who provide liquidity in stress are shrinking. The involuntary holders who provide structural bids are expanding. This isn't a market. It's a regulatory construct.

## The Reflexive Loop

Put it all together and you get a reflexive loop:

[IMAGE: 04_reflexive_loop.png]
*Figure 5: The reflexive loop from mismatch risk to hollow rally*

1. Duration mismatch creates "risk"
2. Regulators force de-risking via Living Wills, SLR, LCR
3. Liquidity gets recycled into HQLA
4. Banks are forced into Treasuries
5. Mechanical bid supports hollow rally
6. Rally persists on fragile, regulatory scaffolding

The problem is becoming the solution is becoming the next problem.

## Why This Matters

This explains a few things:

**1. Why Treasuries have been resilient despite massive supply.** There's a structural bid that has nothing to do with sentiment or Fed expectations. It's regulatory.

**2. Why the hollow rally could persist.** If banks are mechanically forced into Treasuries to satisfy capital ratios, that bid can support Treasury prices even as fiscal deficits explode and labor markets deteriorate.

**3. Why the snap-back could be violent.** Mechanical buyers create brittle liquidity. When stress arrives and these forced holders need to rebalance, there's no marginal buyer behind them. The bid isn't deep. It's regulatory scaffolding.

---

## What Would Change My Mind

This framework relies on the current regulatory regime staying intact. If we saw:

- Regulatory relief on SLR or NSFR that gave banks more flexibility in HQLA composition
- A shift in resolution planning requirements that reduced the pressure to dismantle internal NBFIs
- Bank reserves expanding materially (not just Fed balance sheet maintenance)

...then the forced bid would weaken, and Treasuries would need to reprice to attract natural buyers at higher yields.

But until then, we're not in a free market for Treasury demand. We're in a regulatory mandate.

---

## The Bottom Line

Don't just watch the yield curve. Watch the FR Y-9C filings. Watch the HQLA composition reports. The liquidity isn't leaving the system. It's being channeled into Treasuries by the same regulations meant to "de-risk" banks.

The hollow rally has structural support. That doesn't make it durable. It makes the mechanics more complex and the eventual resolution more abrupt when the scaffolding fails.

Reflexivity cuts both ways.

That's our view from The Watch. Until next time, we'll be sure to keep the light on...
