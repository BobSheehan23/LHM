The macro herd is obsessed with "SVB 2.0" duration mismatch risk.

Banks sitting on $337B in unrealized losses. Long-dated securities underwater. The narrative writes itself.

What they're missing: the same mismatch creating the risk is now creating a mechanical, involuntary bid for US Treasuries.

Here's the reflexive loop:

→ Duration mismatch creates "risk"
→ Regulators force de-risking (Living Wills, SLR, LCR)
→ Liquidity gets recycled into High-Quality Liquid Assets
→ Banks are forced into Treasuries
→ Mechanical bid supports hollow rally

The data:
• Treasuries now 72% of HQLA (up from 40% in 2015)
• Treasury holdings: 3% of bank assets in 2013 → 11% today
• Treasury supply up 460% since 2007
• Dealer capacity down 45%

This isn't banks making an asset allocation decision. It's regulatory physics.

The involuntary holder expands while the market-maker shrinks.

Why it matters:

1. Treasuries stay resilient despite massive supply (regulatory bid, not sentiment)
2. The hollow rally could persist longer than fundamentals suggest
3. When the scaffolding fails, the snap-back could be violent

Don't just watch the yield curve. Watch the FR Y-9C filings.
