# Catalog of FRED series grouped by stakeholder-defined categories.
#
# This skeleton document is intentionally light on content. The follow-up
# task will populate each category with 50-100 vetted time series once the
# stakeholder confirms the proposed structure. Each entry should provide
# at minimum the ``series_id`` and a human-readable ``title``.
